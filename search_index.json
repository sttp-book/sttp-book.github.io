This book is organised as follows:\n\nGetting started with software testing: Why is software testing such a challenging task? Why can't we find all the bugs in a software system? How expensive and/or feasible would it be if a developer decides to test all the possible scenarios in a software system? In this section, we explain to the reader the so-called principles of software testing. Moreover, we introduce the reader to the idea of automating the test cases with the help of JUnit, the standard Java testing framework. JUnit (and later other tools such as Mockito and Selenium) are used throughout this book.\n\nTesting techniques: The main goal of software testing is to reveal bugs in the system under test. This section is entirely dedicated to techniques that aim at detecting those bugs as efficiently as possible. The chapters will cover specification-based techniques (i.e., deriving tests based on textual requirements of the system), structural techniques (i.e., deriving tests based on the structure of the source code), boundary testing (i.e., testing whether the system behaves correctly when inputs are near the boundaries of the input domain), model-based testing (i.e., deriving tests from more formal documentation, such as state machines or decision tables), and design-by-contracts and property-based testing (i.e., devising explicit contracts to methods and classes and ensuring that they behave correctly when these contracts are met).\n\nPragmatic software testing: Testing becomes more complicated once the software systems under test get more complicated. And, on top of that, given how fast companies ship their software today, software testing is now a tool in the developers' belt. In this section, we cover techniques that help developers in writing their tests more effectively. Moreover, we discuss what design and architectural decisions developers can take to ease the testing process (the so-called design for testability). Finally, given test cases are implemented as code, we discuss best practices on how to write and maintain them.\n\nIntelligent testing: Can machines also devise test cases? Up to this section, test cases were mostly devised by humans (and only later written as test code, so that the machine could run them). In this section, we discuss state-of-the-art ideas on how machines can also help developers in exploring systems and look out for crashes. We cover techniques such as mutation testing, fuzzing testing, and search-based software testing.\n\nTesting in the context: Context is king. In this chapter, we discuss some techniques and tools to test software systems in specific contexts, such as web applications, mobile applications, and embedded systems. We also cover the more recent idea of Continuous Experimentation (which can be seen as a validation strategy).\n\nNon-functional testing: Non-functional requirements are extremely important in some software systems. In this section, we cover different testing techniques to ensure that the security and performance requirements of the systems are met. Moreover, and highly timely, we discuss the role of software testers in building ethical software systems.\n\n\n"},"chapters/getting-started/":{"url":"chapters/getting-started/","title":"Getting started with software testing","keywords":"","body":"Getting started with software testing\nIn this section, we introduce the reader to the idea of software testing and its importance. More specifically, we discuss the following topics:\n\nWhy software testing?: By means of a simple example, we will convince the reader that proper testing is a fundamental activity that needs to be done to achieve high-quality software systems. We will also convince the reader that, while the process of deriving test cases is a manual activity, its execution should be automated.\n\nPrinciples of software testing: We explain to the reader some of the \"truths\" about testing software. Among others, we explain why exhaustive testing is infeasible, and why we need to vary the testing techniques we apply in order to keep finding bugs.\n\nSoftware testing automation: We introduce to the reader the JUnit tool. JUnit is the de-facto industry standard for writing automated tests in Java. We show that, once tests are automated, software development teams enjoy benefits, such as confident refactoring. This is an introductory chapter; readers that are familiar with JUnit can skip it.\n\n\n"},"chapters/getting-started/why-software-testing.html":{"url":"chapters/getting-started/why-software-testing.html","title":"Why software testing?","keywords":"","body":"Why software testing?\nWhy should we actually care about software testing?\nBecause bugs are everywhere! \nAs a person who is probably highly dependent on software technology, you should have encountered a few software bugs in your life. Some of them probably did not affect you that much. For example, maybe your Alarm app on your mobile phone crashed, and you did not wake up in time for a meeting. However, some other bugs might have (negatively) affected your life. Societies all over the world have faced critical issues due to software bugs, from medical devices that do not work properly and harm patients, to electric power plants that completely shut down.\nAnd, while these software systems we gave as examples might seem far out from most developers' daily jobs, it is impressively easy to make mistakes even in less critical/complex software systems.\nTo illustrate how hard it is to spot bugs, let's start with a requirement:\n\nRequirement: Min-max\nImplement a program that, given a list of numbers (integers), returns \nthe smallest and the largest numbers in this list.\n\nThis looks like a very simple program to implement; maybe even an exercise for an Introduction to Programming course. \nA first implementation in Java could be as follows:\npublic class NumFinder {\n  private int smallest = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n  private int largest = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n\n  public void find(int[] nums) {\n    for(int n : nums) {\n      if(n  largest) largest = n;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // getters for smallest and largest\n}\n\nThe idea behind the code is as follows: we go through all the elements of the nums list and store the smallest and the largest numbers in two different variables.\nIf n is smaller than the smallest number we have seen so far, we replace the smallest number by n. The same idea applies to the largest number: \nif n is bigger than the largest number, we just replace it by n. \nA common technique developers use (which we will try as much as possible to convince you  not to do) is that they implement the program based on the requirements, and then perform \"small checks\" to make sure the program works as expected. (Note that these \"small checks\" are what we will fight against; developers should perform rigorous and systematic testing to make sure their program works!)\nFor the sake of the argument, let us do a \"small check\" on the program we just wrote. A simple way of doing it would be to come up with a \"main\" method that exercises the program a few times. \nSuppose that the developer then tried their implementation with 4, 25, 7, and 9 as inputs. \npublic class NumFinderMain {\n\n  public static void main (String[] args) {\n    NumFinder nf = new NumFinder();\n    nf.find(new int[] {4, 25, 7, 9});\n\n    System.out.println(nf.getLargest());\n    System.out.println(nf.getSmallest());\n  }\n}\n\nThe output of this program is: 25, 4. This means the implementation works as expected. In a larger context, this would mean that the developer can ship this new implementation to the final user, and let them use this new feature. Can we really...?\nNo, we can not. The current implementation does not work for all the possible cases. There's a bug in there! (Can you find the bug? Look at the implementation above and try to find it!)\nThe program does not work properly for the following input: an array with values 4, 3, 2, and 1. For this input, the program returns the following output: -2147483648, 1.\nIn a more generalised way, the implementation does not handle \"numbers in decreasing order\" well enough. \nWe have just found a bug. This is maybe the right time for a reflection: if bugs can occur\neven in simple programs like the ones above, imagine what happens in large complex\nsoftware systems, on which our society relies upon.\nBefore anything else, let us just fix the bug.\nBack to the source code, we see that the bug is \nactually caused by the else if instruction.The else if should actually just be an if. \nTake a moment to understand why.\npublic class NumFinder {\n  private int smallest = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n  private int largest = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n\n  public void find(int[] nums) {\n    for(int n : nums) {\n      if(n  largest) largest = n;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // getters for smallest and largest\n}\n\nAgain, this is indeed a trivial bug. Once you have found it, it might indeed\nlook like an unfortunate mistake. But this kind of mistakes \ncan and do happen all the time. Why? The answer is simple: developers deal \nwith highly complex software systems. Software systems that are composed of millions (if not billions) of lines of code. Software that generates tons of data per second. Software that communicates with hundreds (if not thousands) of external systems in an asynchronous and distributed manner. Software that has millions of user requests per hour. \nIt is simply impossible to predict, during development time, everything that can happen. \nThis is why we need to test software. Because the world is complex, bugs do happen.\nAnd they can really have a huge impact in our lives.\nWhat is the solution? To rigorously and systematically test the software systems we develop.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nGoogle for \"famous software bugs\".

Using the right\nterms helps us understand each other better. We then discuss the differences\nbetween verification and validation. Finally, we discuss some testing principles\nthat will guide us (or, more specifically, force us to perform trade-offs whenever\nwe choose a testing technique) throughout the book.\nFailure, Fault and Error\nIt is common to hear different terms to indicate that a software system\nis not behaving as expected.\nJust to name a few: error, mistake, defect, bug, fault, and failure.\nTo describe the events that led to a software crash more precisely, \nwe need to agree on a certain vocabulary.\nFor now, this comes down to three terms: failure, fault, and error.\nA failure is a component of the (software) system that is not behaving as expected.\nFailures are often visible to the end user.\nAn example of a failure is a mobile app that stops working, or a \nnews website that starts to show yesterday's news on its front page. \nThe software system did something it was not supposed to do.\nFailures are generally caused by faults.\nFaults are also called defects or bugs.\nA fault is the flaw in the component of the system that caused the \nsystem to behave incorrectly. A fault is technical and, in our world, usually refers to \nsource code, such as a comparison in an if statement that uses a \"less than\" operator () instead of a \"greater than\" operator (>). \nA broken connection is an example of a hardware fault.\n\nNote that the existence of a fault in the source code does not necessarily lead to a failure.\nIf the code containing the fault is never executed, it will never cause a failure.\nFailures only occur when the system is being used, and someone notices it not behaving as expected.\n\nFinally, we have an error, also called mistake.\nAn error is the human action that caused the system to run not as expected.\nFor example, a developer didn't cover an obscure condition because they misunderstood\nthe requirement. Plugging a cable into the wrong socket is an example of a hardware mistake. \nIn other words: a mistake by a developer can lead to a fault in the source code that will\neventually result in a failure.\nIn the Min-Max code example of the previous chapter: the failure was the program returning\na large number, the fault was a bad if/else if condition, and the mistake was me not dealing \nproperly with that case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerification and Validation\nVerification and validation are both about \nassessing the quality of a system. However, they do have a subtle difference,\nwhich can be quickly described by a single question:\n\nValidation: Are we building the right software?\nValidation concerns the features that our software system offers, and the customer (i.e., for whom the system is made): \n\nis the system under development what the users really want and/or need?\nis the system actually useful? \n\nValidation techniques, thus, focus on understanding\nwhether the software system is delivering the business value it should deliver. In this book, we only briefly cover validation techniques (see chapters on Continuous Experimentation and on Behaviour-Driven Development).\n\n\n\nVerification: Are we building the system right? \nVerification, on the other hand, is about the system behaving as it \nis supposed to, according to the specification. \nIn simple words, this mostly means that the system behaves without any bugs.\nNote that this does not guarantee that the system is useful: a system might work \nbeautifully, bug-free, but  not deliver the features that customers really need.\n\n\nNote how both validation and verification are fundamental for ensuring\nthe delivery of high-quality software systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of software testing (or why software testing is so hard)\nA simplistic view on software testing is that,\nif we want our systems to be well-tested, all we need to do is to keep adding more tests until it is enough. We wish it were that simple.\nIndeed, a very important part of any software testing process is \nto know when to stop testing.\nAfter all, resources (e.g., money, developers, infrastructure) are limited. Therefore,\nthe goal should always be to maximise the number of bugs found while minimising the \namount of resources we had to spend on finding those bugs.\nCreating too few tests might leave us with a software system that does not behave as intended (i.e., full of bugs).\nOn the other hand, creating tests after tests, without proper consideration, might lead to ineffective tests (besides costing too much time and money).\nGiven resource constraints, we highlight an important principle in \nsoftware testing: exhaustive testing is impossible. It might be impossible\neven if we had unlimited resources. Imagine a software system that has \"just\" 128 different\nflags (or configuration settings). Those flags can be set to either true or false (Booleans) and\nthey can be set independently from the others. The software system behaves differently\naccording to the configured combination of flags. This implies that we need to test all the possible combinations. A simple calculation shows us that 2 possible values for each of the 128 different flags gives 21282^{128}2​128​​ combinations that need to be tested. As a matter\nof comparison, this number is higher than the estimated number of atoms in the universe.\nIn other words, this software system has more possible combinations to be tested than the universe has atoms.\nGiven that exhaustive testing is impossible,\nsoftware testers have to then prioritise the tests they will perform.\nWhen prioritising the test cases, we note that bugs are not uniformly distributed.\nEmpirically, we observe that some components in some software systems present more\nbugs than other components.\nAnother crucial consequence of the fact that exhaustive testing is impossible is that, \nas Dijkstra used to say, program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence.\nIn other words, while we might find more bugs by simply testing more, our test suites,\nhowever large they might be,\nwill never ensure that the software system is 100% bug-free. They will only ensure\nthat the cases we test for behave as expected.\nTo test our software, we need a lot of variation in our tests.\nFor example, we want variety in the inputs when testing a method, \nlike we saw in the examples above.\nTo test the software well, however, we also need variation in \nthe testing strategies that we apply.\nIndeed, an interesting empirical finding is that if testers apply the same testing techniques over and over, they will at some point lose their efficacy. \nThis is described by what is known as the pesticide paradox (which nicely refers to \"bugs\" as an equivalent term for software faults):\n\"Every method you use to prevent or find bugs leaves a residue of \nsubtler bugs against which those methods are ineffectual.\"\nIn practice, this means that no single testing strategy \ncan guarantee that the software under test is bug-free.\nA concrete example might be a team that solely relies on unit testing techniques.\nAt some point, maybe all the bugs that can be captured at unit test level will be found\nby the team; however, the team might miss bugs that only occur at integration level.\nFrom the pesticide paradox, we thus conclude that testers have to use \ndifferent testing strategies to minimise the number of bugs left in the software.\nWhen studying the various testing strategies that we present in this book, \nkeep in mind that combining them all might be a wise decision.\nThe context also plays an important role in how one devises test cases.\nFor example, devising test cases for a mobile app is very different \nfrom devising test cases for a web application, or for software used in a rocket.\nIn other words: testing is context-dependent.\nAgain, while this book mostly focuses on verification techniques, \nlet us not forget that having a low number of bugs is not enough for good software.\nAs we have said before, a program that works flawlessly, but is of no use for its users, \nis still not a good program.\nThat is a common fallacy (also known as the absence-of-errors fallacy) that software testers face when they decide to focus solely\non verification and not so much on validation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nHaving certain terminology helps testers to explain the problems they have with a program or in their software.\nBelow is a small conversation.\nFill in the blanks with one of the following terms: failure, fault, or error.\n\nMark: Hey, Jane, I just observed a (1)       in our software: if the user has multiple surnames, our software doesn't allow them to sign in. \nJane: Oh, that's awful. Let me debug the code so that I can find the (2)      .\nJane (a few minutes later): Mark, I found it! It was my (3)      . I programmed that part, but never thought of this case.\nMark: No worries, Jane! Thanks for fixing it!\n\nExercise 2.\nKelly, a very experienced software tester, visits Books!, a social network focused on matching people based on books they read.\nUsers do not report bugs so often, as Books! developers have strong testing practices in place.\nHowever, users do say that the software is not really delivering what it promises.\nWhat testing principle applies to this problem?\nExercise 3.\nSuzanne, a junior software tester, has just joined a very large online payment company in the Netherlands. As a first task, Suzanne analysed their past two years of bug reports.\nSuzanne observes that more than 50% of bugs have been happening in the International payments module. \nSuzanne then promises her manager that she will design test cases that will completely cover the International payments module, and thus, find \nall the bugs.\nWhich of the following testing principles might explain why this is not possible?\n\nPesticide paradox. \nExhaustive testing.\nTest early.\nDefect clustering.\n\nExercise 4.\nJohn strongly believes in unit testing. In fact, this is the only type of testing he actually\ndoes at any project he's in. All the testing principles below but one might help convince John that he should also focus on different types of testing. \nWhich of the following is the least related when we want to convince John to move away from his 'only unit testing' approach?\n\nPesticide paradox. \nTests are context-dependent.\nAbsence-of-errors fallacy.\nTest early.\n\nReferences\n\nGraham, D., Van Veenendaal, E., & Evans, I.

In this book, we will use JUnit, as\nall our code examples are written in Java. If you are using a different programming language in your daily work, note that testing frameworks in other languages offer similar functionalities.\nWe will now introduce an example program and then use it to demonstrate how to write JUnit tests. \nAll the production and test code used in this book can be found in the code examples repository.\n\n\nRequirement: Roman numerals\nImplement a program that receives a string as a parameter\ncontaining a roman number and then converts it to an integer.\nIn roman numerals, letters represent values:\n\nI = 1\nV = 5\nX = 10\nL = 50\nC = 100\nD = 500\nM = 1000\n\nLetters can be combined to form numbers.\nFor example we make 6 by using 5+1=65 + 1 = 65+1=6 and have the roman number VI\nExample: 7 is VII, 11 is XI and 101 is CI.\nSome numbers need to make use of a subtractive notation to be represented.\nFor example we make 40 not by XXXX, but instead we use $50 - 10 = 40$ and have the roman number XL.\nOther examples: 9 is XI, 40 is XL, 14 is XIV.\nThe letters should be ordered from the highest to the lowest value.\nThe values of each individual letter is added together.\nUnless the subtractive notation is used in which a letter with a lower value is placed in front of a letter with a higher value.\nCombining both these principles we could give our method MDCCCXLII and it should return 1842.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA possible implementation for the Roman Numerals requirement is as follows:\npublic class RomanNumeral {\n  private static Map map;\n\n  static {\n    map = new HashMap<>();\n    map.put('I', 1);\n    map.put('V', 5);\n    map.put('X', 10);\n    map.put('L', 50);\n    map.put('C', 100);\n    map.put('D', 500);\n    map.put('M', 1000);\n  }\n\n  public int convert(String s) {\n    int convertedNumber = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i = next) {\n        convertedNumber += currentNumber;\n      } else {\n        convertedNumber -= currentNumber;\n      }\n    }\n\n    return convertedNumber;\n  }\n}\n\nWith the implementation in hands, the next step is to devise\ntest cases for the program.\nUse your experience as a developer to devise as many test cases as you can.\nTo get you started, a few examples: \n\nT1 = Just one letter, e.g., C should equal 100\nT2 = Different letters combined, e.g., CLV = 155\nT3 = Subtractive notation, e.g., CM = 900\n\nIn future chapters, we will explore how to devise those test cases. The output\nof that stage will often be similar to the one above: a test case number,\nan explanation of what the test is about (we will later call it class or partition),\nand a concrete instance of input that exercises the program in that way, together\nwith the expected output.\nOnce you are done with the \"manual task of devising test cases\", you are ready to move on to the next section, which shows how to turn them into automated test cases using JUnit.\nThe JUnit Framework\nTesting frameworks enable us to write test cases in a way that they can be easily executed by the machine. In Java, the standard framework to write automated tests is JUnit, and its most recent version is 5.x.\nThe steps to create a JUnit class/test is often the following:\n\nCreate a Java class under the directory /src/test/java/roman/ (or whatever test directory your project structure uses). As a convention, the name of the test class is similar to the name of the class under test. For example, a class that tests the RomanNumeral class is often called RomanNumeralTest. In terms of package structure, the test class also inherits the same package as the class under test.\n\nFor each test case we devise for the program/class, we write a test method. A JUnit test method returns void and is annotated with @Test (an annotation that comes from JUnit 5's org.junit.jupiter.api.Test). The name of the test method does not matter to JUnit, but it does matter to us. A best practice is to name the test after the case it tests. \n\nThe test method instantiates the class under test and invokes the method under test. The test method passes the previously defined input in the test case definition to the method/class. The test method then stores the result of the method call (e.g., in a variable).\n\nThe test method asserts that the actual output matches the expected output. The expected output was defined during the test case definition phase. To check the outcome with the expected value, we use assertions. An assertion checks whether a certain expectation is met; if not, it throws an AssertionError and thereby causes the test to fail. A couple of useful assertions are:\n\nAssertions.assertEquals(expected, actual): Compares whether the expected and actual values are equal. The test fails otherwise. Be sure to pass the expected value as the first argument, and the actual value (the value that comes from the program under test) as the second argument.\nOtherwise the fail message of the test will not make sense.\nAssertions.assertTrue(condition): Passes if the condition evaluates to true, fails otherwise.\nAssertions.assertFalse(condition): Passes if the condition evaluates to false, fails otherwise.\nMore assertions and additional arguments can be found in JUnit's documentation. To make easy use of the assertions and to import them all in one go, you can use import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;.\n\n\n\nThe three test cases we have devised can be automated as follows:\nimport static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\n\npublic class RomanNumeralTest {\n\n  @Test\n  void convertSingleDigit() {\n    RomanNumeral roman = new RomanNumeral();\n    int result = roman.convert(\"C\");\n\n    assertEquals(100, result);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  void convertNumberWithDifferentDigits() {\n    RomanNumeral roman = new RomanNumeral();\n    int result = roman.convert(\"CCXVI\");\n\n    assertEquals(216, result);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  void convertNumberWithSubtractiveNotation() {\n    RomanNumeral roman = new RomanNumeral();\n    int result = roman.convert(\"XL\");\n\n    assertEquals(40, result);\n  }\n}\n\nAt this point, if you see other possible test cases (there are!), go ahead and implement them.\n\n\n\n\n\nTest code engineering matters\nIn practice, developers write (and maintain!) thousands of test code lines. \nTaking care of the quality of test code is therefore of utmost importance.\nWhenever possible, we will introduce you to some best practices in test\ncode engineering.\nIn the test code above, we create the roman object four times.\nHaving a fresh clean instance of an object for each test method is a good idea, as \nwe do not want \"objects that might be already dirty\" (and thus, being the cause for the test to fail, and not because there was a bug in the code) in our test. \nHowever, having duplicated code is not desirable. The problem with duplicated test code\nis the same as in production code: if there is a change to be made, the change has to be made\nin all the points where the duplicated code exists.\nIn this example, we should try to isolate the line of code responsible for creating\nthe class under test.\nIn order to do so, we can use the @BeforeEach feature that JUnit provides.\nJUnit runs methods that are annotated with @BeforeEach before every test method.\nWe therefore can instantiate the roman object inside a method annotated with BeforeEach.\nAlthough you might be asking yourself: \"But it is just a single line of code... Does it really matter?\", remember that as test code becomes more complicated, the more important test code quality becomes.\nThe new test code would look as follows:\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\n\nimport static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;\n\nclass RomanNumeralTest {\n\n  private RomanNumeral roman;\n\n  @BeforeEach\n  void setup() {\n    roman = new RomanNumeral();\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  void convertSingleDigit() {\n    int result = roman.convert(\"C\");\n    assertEquals(100, result);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  void convertNumberWithDifferentDigits() {\n    int result = roman.convert(\"CCXVI\");\n    assertEquals(216, result);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  void convertNumberWithSubtractiveNotation() {\n    int result = roman.convert(\"XL\");\n    assertEquals(40, result);\n  }\n}\n\nFeel free to read more about JUnit's annotations in its documentation.\nYou can also see a video of us refactoring the MinMax test cases. Although the test suite was still small, it had many opportunities for better test code.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe discuss test code quality in a more systematic way in a future \nchapter.\nTests and refactoring\nA more experienced Java developer might be looking at our implementation of the\nRoman Numeral problem and thinking that there are more elegant ways of implementing it.\nThat is indeed true. Software refactoring is a constant activity in software\ndevelopment. \nHowever, how can one refactor the code and still make sure it presents the same behaviour?\nWithout automated tests, that might be a costly activity. Developers would have to perform\nmanual tests after every single refactoring operation. Software refactoring activities benefit\nfrom extensive automated test suites, as developers can refactor their code and, in a matter\nof seconds or minutes, get a clear feedback from the tests.\nSee this new version of the RomanNumeral class, where we deeply refactored the code:\n\nWe gave a better name to the method: we call it asArabic() now.\nWe made a method for single char conversion using method overloading with asArabic()\nWe inlined the declaration of the Map, and used the Map.of utility method.\nWe create an array of characters from the string\nWe make a stream of indices of the character array\nWe map each character to its subtractive value\nWe extracted a private method that decides whether it is a subtractive operation isSubtractive().\nWe extracted getSubtractiveValue() to return a negative number if it's subtractive\nWe made use of the var keyword, as introduced in Java 10.\n\npublic class RomanNumeral {\n  private final static Map CHAR_TO_DIGIT = \n          Map.of('I', 1, 'V', 5, 'X', 10, 'L', 50, 'C', 100, 'D', 500, 'M', 1000);\n\n  public static int asArabic(String roman) {\n    var chars = roman.toCharArray();\n    return IntStream.range(0, chars.length)\n            .map(i -> getSubtractiveValue(chars, i, asArabic(chars[i])))\n            .sum();\n  }\n\n  public static int asArabic(char c) {\n    return CHAR_TO_DIGIT.get(c);\n  }\n\n  private static int getSubtractiveValue(char[] chars, int i, int currentNumber) {\n    return isSubtractive(chars, i, currentNumber) ? -currentNumber : currentNumber;\n  }\n\n  private static boolean isSubtractive(char[] chars, int i, int currentNumber) {\n    return i + 1 \nThe number of refactoring operations is not small. And experience shows us that a lot\nof things can go wrong. Luckily, we now have an automated test suite that we can run and\nget some feedback.\nLet us also take the opportunity and improve our test code:\n\nGiven that our goal was to isolate the single line of code that instantiated the class under test, instead of using the @BeforeEach, we now instantiate it directly in the class. JUnit creates a new instance of the test class before each test (again, as a way to help developers in avoiding test cases that fail due to previous test executions). This allows us to mark the field as final.\nWe inlined the method call and the assertion. Now tests are written in a single line.\nWe give test methods better names. It is common to rename test methods; the more we understand the problem, the more we can give good names to the test cases.\nWe devised one more test case and added it to the test suite.\n\npublic class RomanNumeralTest {\n  /*\n  JUnit creates a new instance of the class before each test,\n  so test setup can be assigned as instance fields.\n  This has the advantage that references can be made final\n  */\n  final private RomanNumeral roman = new RomanNumeral();\n\n  @Test\n  public void singleNumber() {\n      Assertions.assertEquals(1, roman.asArabic(\"I\"));\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void numberWithManyDigits() {\n      Assertions.assertEquals(8, roman.asArabic(\"VIII\"));\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void numberWithSubtractiveNotation() {\n      Assertions.assertEquals(4, roman.asArabic(\"IV\"));\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void numberWithAndWithoutSubtractiveNotation() {\n      Assertions.assertEquals(44, roman.asArabic(\"XLIV\"));\n  }\n}\n\nLessons to be learned: \n\nGet to know your testing framework. \nNever stop refactoring your production code.\nNever stop refactoring your test code.\n\nAdvantages of test automation\nHaving an automated test suite brings several advantages to software\ndevelopment teams. Automated test suites:\n\nAre less prone to obvious mistakes. Developers who perform manual testing several times a day might make mistakes, e.g., by forgetting to execute a test case, by mistakenly marking a test as passed when the software actually exhibited faulty behaviour, etc.\n\nExecute tests faster than developers. The machine can run test cases way faster than developers can. Just imagine more complicated scenarios where the developers would have to type long sequences of inputs, verify the output at several different parts of the system. An automated test runs and gives feedback orders of magnitude faster than developers.\n\nBrings confidence during refactoring. As we just saw in the example, automated test suites enables developers to refactor their code more constantly. After all, developers know that they have a safety net; if something goes wrong, the test will fail.\n\n\nClearly, at first, one might argue that writing test code might feel like a loss in productivity. \nAfter all, developers now have to not only write production code, but also test code.\nDevelopers now have to not only maintain production code, but also maintain test code.\n This could not be further from the truth.\n Once you master the tools and techniques, formalising test cases as JUnit methods\nwill actually save you time; imagine how many times you have executed the same \nmanual test over and over. How much time have you lost by doing \nthe same task repeatedly? \nStudies have shown that developers who write tests spend less time debugging their systems when compared to developers who do not (Janzen), that the\nimpact in productivity is not as significant as one would think (Maximilien and Williams), \nand that bugs\nare fixed faster (Lui and Chen). Truth be told: \nthese experiments compared teams using Test-Driven Development (TDD) against teams not\nusing TDD, and not the existence of a test suite per se. Still, the presence of test code\nis the remarking characteristic that emerges from TDD. Nevertheless, as a society,\nwe might not need more evidence on the benefits of test automation. If we look around,\nfrom small and big companies to big open source projects, they all rely on extensive\ntest suites to ensure quality. Testing (and test automation) pays off.\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nImplement the RomanNumeral class.

In simple words, the goal of this stage\nis to systematically devise different test cases that together will give us a certain level\nof confidence as to whether the software is ready to be shipped or not.\nDevising test cases is an activity that is often done by humans (although we will explore the state-of-the-art in software testing research, where machines also try to \ndevise test cases for us). After all, it requires good knowledge of the requirements.\nIn the Roman Numeral example of a previous chapter, we devised three test cases during\nthe test case design phase.\nThe second task is about executing the test cases we have devised. \nWe often do it by running the software system, feeding it with the inputs we crafted, \nand checking whether the system responded in the way we expected.\nAlthough this phase can also be done by humans, this is an activity that we can easily automate.\nAs we discussed before, we can (and should) write a program that runs our software and executes the test cases. \nAs a side note, in industry, the term \"automated software testing\" is often related to the automatic execution of test cases (that were manually devised). In academia, whenever a research paper says \"automated software testing\", it means automatically creating test cases (by means of artificial intelligence techniques, for instance).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to devising test cases, while our experience helps us deeply in finding bugs, it might not be enough: \n\nExperience-based testing is highly prone to mistakes. The developer might forget to test a corner case.\nIt varies from person to person. Our goal is to define techniques such that any developer in the world is able to test any software.\nWithout clear criteria, it is difficult to know when to stop testing. Our gut feelings might not be precise enough.\n\nThe following chapters aim at exploring different techniques to effectively,\nrigorously, and systematically test a \nsoftware system, and how to automate as many steps on the way as possible.\nThese techniques will rely on the different artefacts that are present during the \nsoftware development process. \nMore specifically, we will discuss the following topics :\n\nSpecification-based testing: Techniques to derive tests from textual requirements. Understanding the category/partition method and  equivalence partitioning .\n\nBoundary testing: Deriving tests that exercise the boundaries of our requirement.\n\nStructural testing: Test cases based on the structure of the source code.\n\nModel-based testing: Leveraging more formal documentation such as state machines and decision tables to derive tests. \n\nDesign-by-contracts: Devising explicit contracts for methods and classes to ensure that they behave correctly when these contracts are (and are not) met.\n\nProperty-based testing: Deriving properties of the system (similar to contracts) and using them to automatically generate test cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nYu, C.

These use the requirements of the program (often written as text; think of user stories and/or UML use cases) as input for testing.\nIn simple terms, we devise a set\nof inputs, where each input tackles one part (or partition)\nof the program.\nGiven that specification-based techniques require no knowledge\nof how the software inside the “box” is structured\n(i.e., it does not matter if it is developed in Java or Python and concrete implementation details [such as usage of a particular data structure] are not of importance), these techniques are also referred to\nas black box testing.\nPartitioning the input space\nPrograms are usually too complex to be tested with just a single test case.\nThere are different cases in which the program is executed \nand its execution often depends on various factors, such as the input\nto the program.\nLet's use a small program as an example. The specification below talks about a program that decides whether a given year is a leap year or not. \n\nRequirement: Leap year\nGiven a specific year as an input, the program should return true if \nthe provided year is a leap year and false if it is not.\nA year is a leap year if:\n\nthe year is divisible by 4;\nand the year is not divisible by 100;\nexcept when the year is divisible by 400 (because then it is still a leap year)\n\n\nTo find a good set of test cases, often referred to as a test suite,\nwe split the program into classes.\nIn other words, we divide the input space of\nthe program in such a way that:\n1) Each class is different, i.e. it is unique, where\nno two partitions represent/exercise the same behaviour;\n2) We can easily verify whether the behaviour for a given input is correct or not.\nBy looking at the requirements above, we can derive the\nfollowing classes/partitions:\n\nYear is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100 = leap year, TRUE\nYear is divisible by 4, divisible by 100, divisible by 400 = leap year, TRUE\nNot divisible by 4 = not leap year, FALSE\nDivisible by 4, divisible by 100, but not divisible by 400 = not leap year, FALSE\n\nNote how each class above exercises the program in different ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquivalence partitioning\nThe partitions above are not test cases that we can implement directly because\neach partition might be instantiated by an infinite number of inputs. For example,\nfor the partition \"year not divisible by 4\", there are infinitely many numbers\nthat are not divisible by 4 which we could use as concrete inputs to the program.\nSo how do we know which concrete input to instantiate for each of the partitions?\nAs we discussed earlier, each partition exercises the program in a certain way.\nIn other words, all input values from one specific partition will make the program\nbehave in the same way.\nTherefore, any input we select should give us the same result.\nWe assume that, if the program behaves correctly for one given input,\nit will work correctly for all other inputs from that class.\nThis idea of inputs being equivalent to each other\nis called equivalence partitioning.\nThus, it does not matter which precise input we select and one test case per\npartition will be enough.\nLet’s now write some JUnit tests for the leap year problem. Remember that the name of a test method\nin JUnit can be anything. It is good to name your test method after the \npartition that the method tests.\nWe discuss more about test code quality and best practices in writing test code in\na future chapter.\n\nThe Leap Year specification has been implemented by a developer in the following way:\npublic class LeapYear {\n\n  public boolean isLeapYear(int year) {\n    if (year % 400 == 0)\n      return true;\n    if (year % 100 == 0)\n      return false;\n\n    return year % 4 == 0;\n  }\n}\n\nWith the classes we devised above, we have 4 test cases in total (i.e., one test case\nfor each class/partition).\nAs any input can be used for a given partition,\nthe following inputs will be used for the partitions:\n\n2016, divisible by 4, not divisible by 100.\n2000, divisible by 4, also divisible by 100 and by 400.\n39, not divisible by 4.\n1900, divisible by 4 and 100, not by 400.\n\nImplementing this using JUnit gives the following code for the tests:\npublic class LeapYearTests {\n\n  private LeapYear leapYear;\n\n  @BeforeEach\n  public void setup() {\n    leapYear = new LeapYear();\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void leapYearsNotCenturialTest() {\n    boolean leap = leapYear.isLeapYear(2016);\n    assertTrue(leap);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void leapYearsCenturialTest() {\n    boolean leap = leapYear.isLeapYear(2000);\n    assertTrue(leap);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void nonLeapYearsTest() {\n    boolean leap = leapYear.isLeapYear(39);\n    assertFalse(leap);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void nonLeapYearsCenturialTest() {\n    boolean leap = leapYear.isLeapYear(1900);\n    assertFalse(leap);\n  }\n}\n\nNote that each test method covers one of the partitions and the naming of the method refers to the partition it covers.\nFor those who are learning JUnit: Note that the setup method is executed \nbefore each test, thanks to the BeforeEach annotation.\nFor each test, it creates a new LeapYear object.\nThis object is then used by the tests to execute the method under test.\nIn each test we first determine the result of the method.\nAfter the method returns a value, we assert that this is the expected value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory-Partition Method\nSo far we have derived partitions by just looking at the specification of the program.\nWe basically used our experience and knowledge to derive the test cases.\nIn this chapter, we will discuss a more systematic way of deriving these partitions: the Category-Partition method.\nThe method provides us with a systematic way of deriving test cases, based on the characteristics of the input parameters. It also reduces the number of tests to a feasible number.\nWe now set out the steps of this method and then we illustrate the process with an example.\n\nIdentify the parameters, or the input of the program. For example, the parameters your classes and methods receive.\nDerive characteristics of each parameter. For example, an int year should be a positive integer number between 0 and infinite. \n\nSome of these characteristics can be found directly in the specification of the program.\nOthers might not be found from specifications. For example, an input cannot be null if the method does not handle that well.\n\n\nAdd constraints in order to minimise the test suite.\n\nIdentify invalid combinations. For some characteristics it might not be possible to combine them with other characteristics.\nExceptional behaviour does not always have to be combined with all the different values of the other inputs. For example, trying a single null input might be enough to test that corner case.\n\n\nGenerate combinations of the input values. These are the test cases.\n\n\nLet's apply the technique in the following program:\n\nRequirement: Christmas discount\nThe system should give a 25% discount on the cart when it is Christmas.\nThe method has two input parameters: the total price of the products in the cart, and the date.\nWhen it is not Christmas it just returns the original price; otherwise it applies the discount.\n\nFollowing the category-partition method:\n\nWe have two parameters:\n\nThe current date\nThe total price\n\n\nNow for each parameter we define the characteristics as:\n\nBased on the requirements, the only important characteristic is that the date can be either Christmas or not.\nThe price can be a positive number, or in certain circumstances it may be 0. Technically the price can also be a negative number. This is an exceptional case, as you cannot pay a negative amount.\n\n\nThe number of characteristics and parameters is not too large in this case. As the negative price is an exceptional case, we can test this with just one combination, instead of with a date that is Christmas and a date that is not Christmas.\n\nWe combine the other characteristics to get the following test cases:\n\nPositive price on Christmas\nPositive price not on Christmas\nPrice of 0 on Christmas\nPrice of 0 not on Christmas\nNegative price on Christmas\n\n\n\nNow we can implement these test cases.\nEach of the test cases corresponds to one of the partitions that we want to test.\n\n\n\n\n\nWalking example\n\nRequirement: Chocolate bars\nA package stores a certain number of chocolate bars in kilos.\nA package is composed of small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each).\nAssume that the package is always filled with the maximum number of big bars possible, return the number of small bars required to complete the package. \nReturn -1 if it is not possible to fill the package completely.\nThe input of the program is: the number of available small bars, the number of available big bars, and the total number of kilos of the package.\n\nA possible implementation for this program is as follows:\npublic class ChocolateBars {\n\n    public static final int CANNOT_PACK_BAG = -1;\n\n    public int calculate(int small, int big, int total) {\n        int maxBigBoxes = total / 5;\n        int bigBoxesWeCanUse = Math.min(maxBigBoxes, big);\n        total -= (bigBoxesWeCanUse * 5);\n\n        if(small \nIn this requirement, the partitions are less clear and it is essential to understand the problem fully\nin order to derive the partitions.\nOne way to perform the analysis is to consider how the input variables affect the output variables. We observe that:\n\nThere are three input variables: number of small bars, number of big bars, number of kilos in a package. They are all integers and values can range from 0 to infinite.\nGiven a valid number of kilos in a package, the outcome is then based on the number of big bars and number of small bars. This means we can not analyse each variable separately, but only together.\n\nWe derive the following classes / partitions:\n\nNeed only small bars. A solution that only uses small bars (and does not use big bars).\nNeed only big bars. A solution that only uses the big bars (and does not use small bars).\nNeed small + big bars. A solution that has to use both small and big bars.\nNot enough bars. A case in which it is impossible, because there are not enough bars.\n\nWe also derive an invalid class:\n\nNot from the specs: An exceptional case (e.g., negative numbers in any of the inputs).\n\nFor each of these classes, we can devise five concrete test cases:\n\nNeed only small bars. small = 4, big = 2, total = 3\nNeed only big bars. small = 5, big = 3, total = 10\nNeed small + big bars. small = 5, big = 3, total = 17\nNot enough bars. small = 1, big = 1, total = 10\nNot from the specs: small = -1, big = -1, total = -1\n\nIn JUnit code:\npublic class ChocolateBarsTest {\n    private final ChocolateBars bars = new ChocolateBars();\n\n    @Test\n    void notEnoughBars() {\n        assertEquals(-1, bars.calculate(1, 1, 10));\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    void onlyBigBars() {\n        assertEquals(0, bars.calculate(5, 3, 10));\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    void bigAndSmallBars() {\n        assertEquals(2, bars.calculate(5, 3, 17));\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    void onlySmallBars() {\n        assertEquals(3, bars.calculate(4, 2, 3));\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    void invalidValues() {\n      assertEquals(-1, bars.calculate(-1, -1, -1));\n    }\n}\n\nThis example shows a case where deriving good test cases becomes more challenging due to the\nspecifications being complex.\nIf you know some advanced features of JUnit, you might be wondering why we did not use, e.g., Parameterized Tests. We will refactor this test code in a future chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom testing vs specification-based testing\nOne might think: but what if, instead of looking at the requirements,\na tester just keeps giving random inputs to the program?\nRandom testing is indeed a popular black-box technique where programs are tested by generating random inputs. \nAlthough random testing can definitely help us in finding bugs, it is not an effective way to find bugs in a large input space. \nDevelopers/testers use their experience and knowledge of the program to test trouble-prone areas more effectively.\nHowever, they generate a limited number of tests in a specific time period such as a day,\nwhile computers can generate millions of tests in the same period of time.\nA combination of random testing and partition testing is therefore the most beneficial.\nIn future chapters, fuzzing testing and AI-based testing will be discussed, with information\nabout automated random testing.\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nWhat is an Equivalence Partition?\n\nA group of results that is produced by one method\nA group of results that is produced by one input passed into different methods\nA group of inputs that all make a method behave in the same way\nA group of inputs that gives exactly the same output in every method\n\nExercise 2.\nWe have a program called FizzBuzz.\nIt does the following:\n\nGiven an integer n, return the string form of the number followed by \"!\".\nIf the number is divisible by 3 use \"Fizz\" instead of the number,\nand if the number is divisible by 5 use \"Buzz\" instead of the number,\nand if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, use \"FizzBuzz\"\n\nExamples:\n\nThe integer 3 yields \"Fizz!\"\nThe integer 4 yields \"4!\"\nThe integer 5 yields \"Buzz!\"\nThe integer 15 yields \"FizzBuzz\"\n\nA novice tester is trying hard to devise as many tests as she can for\nthe FizzBuzz method.\nShe came up with the following tests:\n\nT1 = 15\nT2 = 30\nT3 = 8\nT4 = 6\nT5 = 25\n\nWhich of these tests can be removed while keeping a good test suite?\nWhich concept can we use to determine the tests that can be removed?\nExercise 3.\nSee a slightly modified version of the HashMap's put method Javadoc below. (Source code here).\n/**\n * Puts the supplied value into the Map,\n * mapped by the supplied key.\n * If the key is already in the map, its\n * value will be replaced by the new value.\n *\n * NOTE: Nulls are not accepted as keys;\n *  a RuntimeException is thrown when key is null.\n *\n * @param key the key used to locate the value\n * @param value the value to be stored in the HashMap\n * @return the prior mapping of the key, or null if there was none.\n */\npublic V put(K key, V value) {\n  // implementation here\n}\n\nApply the category/partition method.\nWhat are the minimal and most suitable partitions?\nExercise 4.\nZip codes in country X are always composed of 4 numbers + 2 letters, e.g., 2628CD.\nNumbers are in the range [1000, 4000].\nLetters are in the range [C, M].\nConsider a program that receives two inputs: an integer (for the 4 numbers) and a string (for the 2 letters), and returns true (valid zip code) or false (invalid zip code).\nThe boundaries for this program appear to be straightforward:\n\nAnything below 1000 -> invalid\n[1000, 4000] -> valid\nAnything above 4000 -> invalid\n[A, B] -> invalid\n[C, M] -> valid\n[N, Z] -> invalid\n\nBased on what you as a tester assume about the program, which invalid cases can you come up with?\nDescribe these invalid cases and how they might exercise the program based on your assumptions.\nExercise 5.\nSee a slightly modified version of the HashSet's add() Javadoc below.\nApply the category/partition method. What are the minimal and most suitable partitions for the e input parameter? \n/**\n * Adds the specified element to this set if it \n * is not already present.\n * If this set already contains the element, \n * the call leaves the set unchanged\n * and returns false.\n *\n * If the specified element is NULL, the call leaves the\n * set unchanged and returns false.\n *\n * @param e element to be added to this set\n * @return true if this set did not already contain \n *   the specified element\n */\npublic boolean add(E e) {\n    // implementation here\n}\n\nExercise 6.\nWhich of the following statements is false about applying the category/partition method in the Java method below?\n/**\n * Puts the supplied value into the Map, \n * mapped by the supplied key.\n * If the key is already in the map, its\n * value will be replaced by the new value.\n *\n * NOTE: Nulls are not accepted as keys; \n *  a RuntimeException is thrown when key is null.\n *\n * @param key the key used to locate the value\n * @param value the value to be stored in the HashMap\n * @return the prior mapping of the key, \n *  or null if there was none.\n */\npublic V put(K key, V value) {\n  // implementation here\n}\n\n\nThe specification does not specify any details about the value input parameter, and thus, experience should be used to partition it, e.g., value being null and not null.\n\nThe number of tests generated by the category/partition method can grow quickly, as the chosen partitions for each category are later combined one-by-one. This is not a practical problem to the put() method because the number of categories and their partitions is small.\n\nIn an object-oriented language, besides using the method's input parameters to explore partitions, we should also consider the internal state of the object (i.e., the class's attributes), as it can also affect the behaviour of the method.\n\nWith the information in hands, it is not possible to perform the category/partition method, as the source code is required for the last step of the category/partition method: adding constraints.\n\n\nExercise 7.\nConsider a find program that finds occurrences of a pattern in a file, the program has the following syntax:\nfind  \nA tester, after reading the specs and following the Category-Partition method, devised the following test specification:\n\nPattern size: empty, single character, many characters, longer than any line in the file.\nQuoting: pattern is quoted, pattern is not quoted, pattern is improperly quoted.\nFile name: good file name, no file name with this name, omitted.\nOccurrences in the file: none, exactly one, more than one.\nOccurrences in a single line, assuming line contains the pattern: one, more than one.\n\nHowever, the number of combinations is too high now. What actions could we take to reduce the number of combinations?\nExercise 8.\nWhat test cases should be created when taking both the partition of the input parameters and the internal state of the object into account?\n/**\n * Adds the specified element to this set if it \n * is not already present.\n * If this set already contains the element, \n * the call leaves the set unchanged\n * and returns false.\n *\n * If the specified element is NULL, the call leaves the\n * set unchanged and returns false.\n *\n * If the set is full, \n * the call leaves the set unchanged and return false.\n * Use private method `isFull` to know whether the set is already full.\n *\n * @param e element to be added to this set\n * @return true if this set did not already contain \n *   the specified element\n */\npublic boolean add(E e) {\n    // implementation here\n}\n\nReferences\n\nGraham, D., Van Veenendaal, E., & Evans, I.

They fail, however, when the input is \"near the boundary of condition\".\nIn this chapter, we explore boundary testing techniques.\nBoundaries in between classes/partitions\nIn the previous chapter, we studied specification-based techniques and, more specifically,\nwe understood the concept of classes/partitions.\nWhen we devise classes, these have \"close boundaries\"\nwith the other classes. \nIn other words, if we keep performing small changes \nto an input that belongs to some partition (e.g., by adding +1 to it), \nat some point this input will belong to another class. \nThe precise point where the input changes from one class to another is what we call a boundary.\nAnd this is precisely what boundary testing is about: to make the program behave correctly\nwhen inputs are near a boundary.\nMore formally,\nwe can find such boundaries by finding a pair of consecutive \ninput values [p1,p2][p_1,p_2][p​1​​,p​2​​], where p1p_1p​1​​ belongs to partition A, and p2p_2p​2​​ belongs to partition B.\nLet us apply boundary testing in a concrete example:\n\nRequirement: Calculating the number of points of a player\nGiven the score of a player and the number of remaining lives of the player, the program does the following:\n\nIf the player's score is below 50, then it always adds 50 points on top of the current points.\nIf the player's score is greater than or equals to 50, then:\nif the number of remaining lives is greater than or equal to 3, it triples the score of the player.\notherwise, it adds 30 points on top of the current points.\n\n\n\n\nA possible implementation for this method can be:\npublic class PlayerPoints {\n\n  public int totalPoints(int currentPoints, int remainingLives) {\n    if(currentPoints \nWhen devising the partitions to test this method, a tester might come up with the following partitions:\n\nLess points: Score \nMany points but little lives: Score >= 50 and remaining lives \nMany points and many lives: Score >= 50 and remaining lives >= 3\n\nThose partitions would lead testers to devise at least three test cases, one per partition:\npublic class PlayerPointsTest {\n\n  private final PlayerPoints pp = new PlayerPoints();\n\n  @Test\n  void lessPoints() {\n    assertEquals(30+50, pp.totalPoints(30, 5));\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  void manyPointsButLittleLives() {\n    assertEquals(300+30, pp.totalPoints(300, 1));\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  void manyPointsAndManyLives() {\n    assertEquals(500*3, pp.totalPoints(500, 10));\n  }\n}\n\nHowever, a tester who is aware of boundaries also devises test cases that explore the boundaries of the domain.\nLet us explore them: \n\nBoundary 1: When the score is strictly smaller than 50, it belongs to partition 1. If the score is greater than or equal to 50, it belongs to partitions 2 and 3. Therefore, we observe the following boundary: when the score changes from 49 to 50, the partition it belongs to also changes (let us call this test B1).\n\nBoundary 2: Given a score that is greater than or equal to 50, we observe that if the number of remaining lives is smaller than 3, it belongs to partition 2; otherwise, it belongs\nto partition 3. Thus, we just identified another boundary there (let us call this test B2).\n\n\nWe can visualise these partitions with their boundaries in a diagram.\n\nIn our example, the tester would then \ndevise and automate test cases B1 and B2. Given that a boundary is composed of two different input values, note that\neach boundary will require at least two test cases:\nFor B1:\n\nB1.1 = input={score=49, remaining lives=5}, output={99}\nB1.2 = input={score=50, remaining lives=5}, output={150}\n\nFor B2:\n\nB2.1 = input={score 500, remaining lives=3}, output={1500}\nB2.2 = input={score 500, remaining lives=2}, output={530}\n\nAn implementation using JUnit is shown below. Note that we have written just a single test for each pair of test cases. This makes the test more cohesive.\nIf there is a boundary bug, a single test will let us know.\n@Test\nvoid betweenLessAndManyPoints() {\n  assertEquals(49+50, pp.totalPoints(49, 5));\n  assertEquals(50*3, pp.totalPoints(50, 5));\n}\n\n@Test\nvoid betweenLessAndManyLives() {\n  assertEquals(500*3, pp.totalPoints(500, 3));\n  assertEquals(500+30, pp.totalPoints(500, 2));\n}\n\nYou might have noticed that, for B1, in case of score remaining lives makes no difference.\nHowever, for score >= 50, remaining lives does make a difference, as the output can vary according to its value. \nAnd for the B1.2 test case, we chose remaining lives = 5, which makes the\ncondition true. \nYou might be wondering whether you also need to devise another test case, B1.3, where the remaining lives condition would be exercised as false. \nIf you are looking to test all possible combinations, then the answer is yes. However, in longer\nconditions, full of boundaries, the number of combinations might be too high, making it unfeasible for the developer\nto test them all. Later in this chapter, we will learn\nhow to choose values for the \"boundaries that we do not care about\".\n\nOn and off points\nGiven some initial intuition on how to analyse boundaries, let us define some\nterminology:\n\nOn-point: The on-point is the value that is exactly on the boundary. This is the value we see in the condition itself. \nOff-point: The off-point is the value that is closest to the boundary and that flips the condition. If the on-point makes the condition true, the off point makes it false and vice versa. Note that when dealing with equalities or inequalities (e.g. x=6x = 6x=6 or x≠6x \\neq 6x≠6), there are two off-points; one in each direction.\nIn-points: In-points are all the values that make the condition true.\nOut-points: Out-points are all the values that make the condition false.\n\nExample: Suppose we have a program that adds shipping costs when the total price is below 100.\nThe condition used in the program is x100x x100.\n\nThe on-point is 100100100, as that is the value that is precisely in the condition.\nThe on-point makes the condition false (100 is not smaller than 100), so the off-point should be the closest number that makes the condition true.\nThis will be 999999, as 9910099 99100 is true.\nThe in-points are the values which are smaller than or equal to 999999. For example, 37, 42, 56.\nThe out-points are all values which are larger than or equal to 100100100. For example, 325, 1254, 101.\n\nWe show all these points in the diagram below.\n\nLet us now study a similar but slightly different condition: x≤100x \\leq 100x≤100 (the only difference is that, in this one, we use \"less than or equal to\"):\n\nThe on-point is still 100100100: this is the value that is precisely in the condition.\nThe condition is evaluated as true for the on-point. So, the off-point should be the closest number to the on-point, but making the condition false. The off-point is thus 101101101.\n\n\nNote that, depending on the condition, an on-point can be either an in- or an out-point.\nAs a tester, you devise test cases for these different points: a test case for the \non-point, a test case for the off-point, a test case for a single in-point (as all in-points\nbelong to the same equivalence partition), and a test case for a single out-point (as all\nout-points also belong to the same equivalence partition).\nNote that on and off points are also in or out points. Therefore, tests that focus only on the on and off points would also be testing in and out points. In fact, some authors argue that testing boundaries is enough. Moreover, a test that exercises an in-point that is far away from the boundary might not have a strong fault detection capability. Why would we need them?\nThere is no perfect answer here. We suggest:\n\nIf the number of test cases is indeed too high, and it is just too expensive to do them all, prioritization is important, and we suggest testers to indeed focus on the boundaries.\nFar away in/out points are sometimes easier to be seen or comprehended by a tester who is still learning about the system under test, and exploring its boundaries (exploratory testing). Deciding whether to perform such a test is thus a decision that a tester should take, taking the costs into account.\n\n\nRevisiting the \"chocolate bars\" problem\nLet's revisit the example from the a previous chapter. There, we had a program\nwhere the goal was to return the number of bars needed in order to build some boxes of chocolates:\n\nChocolate bars\nA package should store a total number of kilos. \nThere are small bars (1 kilo each) and big bars (5 kilos each). \nWe should calculate the number of small bars to use, \nassuming we always use big bars before small bars. Return -1 if it can't be done.\nThe input of the program is thus the number of small bars, the number of big bars,\nand the total number of kilos to store.\n\nAnd these were the classes we derived after applying the category/partition method:\n\nNeed only small bars. A solution that only uses the provided small bars.\nNeed only big bars. A solution that only uses the provided big bars.\nNeed small + big bars. A solution that has to use both small and big bars.\nNot enough bars. A case in which it's not possible, because there are not enough bars.\nNot from the specs: An exceptional case.\n\nAs we saw in the previous chapter, the following code passed all the tests we derived:\npublic class ChocolateBars {\n    public static final int CANNOT_PACK_BAG = -1;\n\n    public int calculate(int small, int big, int total) {\n        int maxBigBoxes = total / 5;\n        int bigBoxesWeCanUse = Math.min(maxBigBoxes, big);\n        total -= (bigBoxesWeCanUse * 5);\n\n        if(small \nHowever, the following input makes the program to fail: (2,3,17)! \nNote that the input (2,3,17) belongs to the need small + big bars partition. In this case,\nthe program should make use of all the big bars (there are 3 available) and then all the small bars available (there are \n2 available). Note that the buggy program would work if we had 3 available small bars (having (3, 3, 17) as input).\nThe bug lies on the if condition. It should be if(small  instead of\nif(small :\npublic class ChocolateBars {\n    public static final int CANNOT_PACK_BAG = -1;\n\n    public int calculate(int small, int big, int total) {\n        int maxBigBoxes = total / 5;\n        int bigBoxesWeCanUse = Math.min(maxBigBoxes, big);\n        total -= (bigBoxesWeCanUse * 5);\n\n        // we fixed the bug here!\n        if(small \nThis bug is clearly an instance of a bug that should have been detected by boundary testing.\nThe problem is that this boundary is just less explicit from the requirements.\nAs we defined at the beginning of this chapter,\nboundaries also happen when we are going from \"one partition\" to \nanother. There is a \"single condition\" that we can use as clear source.\nIn these cases, what we should do is to devise test cases for a sequence of inputs that move\nfrom one partition to another.\n\nLet us focus on the bug caused by the (2,3,17) input:\n\n(1,3,17) should return not possible (1 small bar is not enough). This test case belongs to the not enough bars partition.\n(2,3,17) should return 2. This test case belongs to need for small + big bars partition.\n\nThe (1,3,17) and (2,3,17) inputs exercise precisely the boundary between the not enough bars and the need for small + big bars partitions. \nLet us know explore the boundaries between other partitions. The figure below shows which boundaries can happen (and that we should test):\n\nLooking at the only big bars partition, we should find inputs that transition from this partition to another one:\n\n(10, 1, 10) returns 5. This input belongs to the need small + big bars partition.\n(10, 2, 10) returns 0. This input belongs to the need only big bars partition.\n\nFinally, with the only small bars partition:\n\n(3, 2, 3) returns 3. We need only small bars here, and therefore, this input belongs to the only small bars partition.\n(2, 2, 3) returns -1. We can't make the boxes. This input belongs to the Not enough bars partition.\n\nA partition might have boundaries with more than just a single other partition. \nThe only small bars partition has boundaries not only with the not enough bars partition (as we saw above), but also with the only big bars partition:\n\n(4, 2, 4) returns 4. We need only small bars here, and therefore, this input belongs to the only small bars partition.\n(4, 2, 5) returns 0. We need only big bars here, and therefore, this input belongs to the only big bars partition.\n\nA lesson we learn from this example is that boundary bugs may not \nonly emerge out of \"clear if conditions\" we\nsee in the implementation. Boundary bugs also happen in more subtle\ninteractions among partitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomating boundary testing with JUnit (via Parameterised Tests)\nYou might have noticed that in the domain matrix we always have a certain number of input values and, implicitly, an expected output value.\nWe could just implement the boundary tests by making a separate method for each test, or by\ngrouping them per boundary, as we have been doing so far.\nHowever, the number of test methods can quickly become large and unmanageable.\nMoreover, the code in these test methods will be largely the same,\nas they all have the same structure, only with different input and output values.\nLuckily, JUnit offers a solution where we can generalise the implementation of a test\nmethod, and run it with different inputs and expected outputs: Parameterised Tests.\nAs the name suggests, with a parameterised test, developers \ncan define a test method with parameters.\nTo define a parameterised test, you make use of the @ParameterizedTest annotation, \ninstead of the usual @Test annotation.\nFor each parameter you want to pass to the \"template test method\", you define a \nparameter in the method's parameter list (note that so far, all our JUnit methods had\nno parameters). For example, a test method t1(int a, int b) receives two parameters,\nint a and int b. The developer uses these two variables in the body of the test\nmethod, often in places where the developer would have a hard-coded value.\nThe next step is to feed JUnit with a list of inputs which will be passed\nto the test method.\nIn general, these values are provided by a Source.\nHere, we will make use of a CsvSource.\nWith it, each test case is given as a comma-separated list of input values.\nTo execute multiple tests with the same test method, \nthe CsvSource expects list of strings, where each string represents \nthe input and output values for one test case.\nThe CsvSource is an annotation itself, so in an implementation \nit would look like the following: @CsvSource({\"value11, value12\", \"value21, value22\", \"value31, value32\", ...})\n@ParameterizedTest(name = \"small={0}, big={1}, total={2}, result={3}\")\n    @CsvSource({\n      // The total is higher than the amount of small and big bars.\n      \"1,1,5,0\", \"1,1,6,1\", \"1,1,7,-1\", \"1,1,8,-1\",\n      // No need for small bars.\n      \"4,0,10,-1\", \"4,1,10,-1\", \"5,2,10,0\", \"5,3,10,0\",\n      // Need for big and small bars.\n      \"0,3,17,-1\", \"1,3,17,-1\", \"2,3,17,2\", \"3,3,17,2\",\n      \"0,3,12,-1\", \"1,3,12,-1\", \"2,3,12,2\", \"3,3,12,2\",\n      // Only small bars.\n      \"4,2,3,3\", \"3,2,3,3\", \"2,2,3,-1\", \"1,2,3,-1\"\n    })\n    void boundaries(int small, int big, int total, int expectedResult) {\n        int result = new ChocolateBars().calculate(small, big, total);\n        Assertions.assertEquals(expectedResult, result);\n    }\n\nSome developers prefer not to pass a list of CSV/strings. For those, JUnit provides a @MethodSource option, which allows developers to provide the input for the parameterized test through a method. The developer simply needs to define a method that returns a Stream (and set the name of this method in the @MethodSource annotation). See the implementation below:\npublic class ChocolateBarsTest {\n\n    @ParameterizedTest(name = \"small={0}, big={1}, total={2}, result={3}\")\n    @MethodSource(\"generator\")\n    void boundaries(int small, int big, int total, int expectedResult) {\n        int result = new ChocolateBars().calculate(small, big, total);\n        Assertions.assertEquals(expectedResult, result);\n    }\n\n    private static Stream generator() {\n      return Stream.of(\n        // The total is higher than the amount of small and big bars.\n        Arguments.of(1,1,5,0),\n        Arguments.of(1,1,6,1),\n        Arguments.of(1,1,7,-1),\n        Arguments.of(1,1,8,-1),\n        // No need for small bars.\n        Arguments.of(4,0,10,-1),\n        Arguments.of(4,1,10,-1),\n        Arguments.of(5,2,10,0),\n        Arguments.of(5,3,10,0),\n        // Need for big and small bars.\n        Arguments.of(0,3,17,-1),\n        Arguments.of(1,3,17,-1),\n        Arguments.of(2,3,17,2),\n        Arguments.of(3,3,17,2),\n        Arguments.of(0,3,12,-1),\n        Arguments.of(1,3,12,-1),\n        Arguments.of(2,3,12,2),\n        Arguments.of(3,3,12,2),\n        // Only small bars.\n        Arguments.of(4,2,3,3),\n        Arguments.of(3,2,3,3),\n        Arguments.of(2,2,3,-1),\n        Arguments.of(1,2,3,-1)\n      );\n\n    }\n}\n\nYou can see all these implementation in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/sttp-book/code-examples/tree/master/src/test/java/tudelft/chocolate. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CORRECT way\nThe book Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java 8 with JUnit, by Langr, Hunt, and Thomas, has an interesting discussion about boundary conditions.\nAuthors call it the CORRECT way, as each letter represents one boundary condition to consider:\n\nConformance:\n\nMany data elements must conform to a specific format. Example: e-mail addresses (always name@domain). If you expect an e-mail address, and you do not receive one, your software might crash.\nRequired action: Test what happens when your input is not in conformance with what is expected.\n\n\nOrdering:\n\nSome inputs might come in a specific order. Imagine a system that receives different products to be inserted in a basket. The order of the data might influence the output. What happens if the list is ordered? Unordered?\nRequired action: Make sure our program works even if the data comes in an unordered manner (or return an elegant failure to user, avoiding the crash).\n\n\nRange:\n\nInputs should usually be within a certain range. Example: Age should always be greater than 0 and smaller than 125.\nRequired action: Test what happens when we provide inputs that are outside of the expected range.\n\n\nReference:\n\nIn OOP systems, objects refer to other objects. Sometimes the relationships between the objects are extensive and there may be external dependencies. What happens if these dependencies do not behave as expected?\nRequired action: When testing a method, consider:\nWhat it references outside its scope\nWhat external dependencies it has\nWhether it depends on the object being in a certain state\nAny other conditions that must exist\n\n\n\n\nExistence:\n\nDoes \"something\" really exist? What if it does not? Imagine you query a database, and your database returns an empty result. Will our software behave correctly?\nRequired action: Does the system behave correctly when something that is expected to exist, does not?\n\n\n\n\nCardinality:\n\nIn simple words, our loop performed one step less (or more) than it should.\nRequired action: Test loops in different situations, such as when it actually performs zero iterations,\none iterations, or many. (Loops are further discussed in the structural testing chapter).\n\n\nTime\n\nSystems rely on dates and times. What happens if the system receives inputs that are not\nordered in regards to date and time?\nTimeouts: Does the system handle timeouts well?\nConcurrency: Does the system handle concurrency well?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquivalent classes and boundary analysis altogether\nWe discussed equivalent class analysis and boundary testing. In practice, testers combine both, in what they call domain testing.\nWe suggest the following strategy when applying domain testing, highly influenced by how Kaner et al. do:\n\nWe read the requirement\nWe identify the input and output variables in play, together with their types, and their ranges.\nWe identify the dependencies (or independence) among input variables, and how input variables influence the output variable.\nWe perform equivalent class analysis (valid and invalid classes).\nWe explore the boundaries of these classes.\nWe think of a strategy to derive test cases, focusing on minimizing the costs while maximizing fault detection capability.\nWe generate a set of test cases that should be executed against the system under test.\n\nSee a series of domain testing examples in our appendix.\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nWe have the following method.\npublic String sameEnds(String string) {\n  int length = string.length();\n  int half = length / 2;\n\n  String left = \"\";\n  String right = \"\";\n\n  int size = 0;\n  for(int i = 0; i \nPerform boundary analysis on the condition in the for-loop: i , i.e. what are the on- and off-point and the in- and out-points?\nYou can give the points in terms of the variables used in the method.\nExercise 2.\nPerform boundary analysis on the following equality: x == 10.\nWhat are the on- and off-points?\nExercise 3.\nA game has the following condition: numberOfPoints .\nPerform boundary analysis on the condition.\nWhat are the on- and off-point of the condition?\nAlso give an example for both an in-point and an out-point.\nExercise 4.\nRegarding boundary analysis of inequalities (e.g., a ), which of the following statements is true?\n\nThere can only be a single on-point which always makes the condition true.\nThere can be multiple on-points for a given condition which may or may not make the condition true.\nThere can only be a single off-point which may or may not make the condition false.\nThere can be multiple off-points for a given condition which always make the condition false.\n\nExercise 5.\nA game has the following condition: numberOfPoints > 1024. Perform a boundary analysis.\nExercise 6.\nPerform boundary analysis on the following decision: n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 == 0.\nWhat are the on- and off-points?\nExercise 7.\nWhich one of the following statements about the CORRECT principles is true?\n\nWe assume that external dependencies are already on the right state for the test (REFERENCE).\nWe test different methods from the same class in an isolated way in order to avoid order issues (TIME).\nWhenever we encounter a loop, we always test whether the program works for 0, 1, and 10 iterations (CARDINALITY).\nWe always test the behaviour of our program when any expected data does not exist (EXISTENCE).\n\nExercise 8.\nWe have a program called IsCat.\nIt works as follows:\n\nGiven an list of prerequisites, it returns either the string \"Cat\" or the string \"Doge\".\nIf the number of legs is an even number, it has a tail, the number of lives left is between [0, 9], it has sharp nails and the sounds it produces is \"miauw\", it is a cat.\nIn any other case, it is a doge.\n\nFirst, do boundary analysis on the inputs.\nThink of on and off points for each of the conditions (while picking in points for the others).\nNext, appply the category/partition method.\nWhat are the minimal and most suitable partitions?\nReferences\n\nJeng, B., & Weyuker, E.

These coverage criteria relate closely to test coverage, a concept that many developers know. By test coverage, we mean the amount (or percentage) of production code that is exercised by the tests.\nWe will cover the following coverage criteria:\n\nLine coverage (and statement coverage)\nBlock coverage\nBranch/Decision coverage\nCondition (Basic and Condition+Branch) coverage\nPath coverage\nMC/DC coverage\n\nWatch a summary of one of our lectures in structural testing:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we need structural testing?\nIn a nutshell, for two reasons: \n1) to systematically derive tests from source code;\n2) to know when to stop testing;\nAs a tester, when performing specification-based testing, \nyour goal was clear: to derive classes out of the requirement specifications, and then to derive test cases for each of the\nclasses. You were satisfied once all the classes and boundaries\nwere systematically exercised.\nThe same idea applies to structural testing. First, it gives\nus a systematic way to devise tests. As we will see, a tester\nmight focus on testing all the lines of a program; or focus\non the branches and conditions of the program. Different\ncriteria produce different test cases. \nSecond, to know\nwhen to stop. It is easy to imagine that the number of possible paths in a mildly complex piece of code is just too large, and exhaustive testing is impossible. Therefore, having clear criteria on when to stop helps testers in understanding\nthe costs of their testing.\nLine (and statement) coverage\nAs the name suggests, when determining the line coverage, we look at the number of lines of code that are covered by the tests (more specifically,\nby at least one test).\nSee the following example: \n\nRequirement: Black-jack\nThe program receives the number of points of two blackjack players.\nThe program must return the number of points of the winner.\nIn blackjack, whoever gets closer to 21 points wins. \nIf a player goes over 21 points,\nthe player loses. If both players lose, the program must return 0.\n\nSee the following implementation for the requirement above:\npublic class BlackJack {\n  public int play(int left, int right) {\n1.  int ln = left;\n2.  int rn = right;\n3.  if (ln > 21)\n4.    ln = 0;\n5.  if (rn > 21)\n6.    rn = 0;\n7.  if (ln > rn)\n8.    return ln;\n9.  else\n10.   return rn;\n  }\n}\n\nLet us now devise and implement two test cases for this method:\npublic class BlackJackTests {\n  @Test\n  void bothPlayersGoTooHigh() {\n    int result = new BlackJack().play(30, 30);\n    assertThat(result).isEqualTo(0);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  void leftPlayerWins() {\n    int result = new BlackJack().play(10, 9);\n    assertThat(result).isEqualTo(10);\n  }\n}\n\nThe first test executes lines 1-7, 9, and 10 as both values are higher than 21.\nThis means that, after the bothPlayersGoTooHigh test, 9 out of the 10 lines are covered. Thus, line coverage is 910⋅100%=90%\\frac{9}{10}\\cdot100\\% = 90\\%​10​​9​​⋅100%=90%.\nLine 8 is therefore the only line that the first test does not cover.\nThe second test, leftPlayerWins, complements the first test, and executes lines 1-3, 5, 7 and 8.\nBoth tests together now achieve a line coverage of 100%100\\%100%, as together they cover\nall the 10 different lines of the program.\nMore formally, we can compute line coverage as: \nline coverage=lines coveredlines total⋅100%\\text{line coverage} = \\frac{\\text{lines covered}}{\\text{lines total}} \\cdot 100\\%line coverage=​lines total​​lines covered​​⋅100%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is line coverage problematic?\nUsing lines of code as a way to determine line coverage is a simple and straightforward idea.\nHowever, counting the covered lines is not always a good way of calculating the coverage.\nThe number of lines in a piece of code depends on the \ndecisions taken by the programmer who writes the code. \nLet us look again at the Black Jack example.\nThe play method can also be written in 6 lines, instead of 10:\npublic int play(int left, int right) {\n1.  int ln = left;\n2.  int rn = right;\n3.  if (ln > 21) ln = 0;\n4.  if (rn > 21) rn = 0;\n5.  if (ln > rn) return ln;\n6.  else return rn;\n}\n\nThe leftPlayerWins test covered 610\\frac{6}{10}​10​​6​​ lines in the previous\nimplementation of the play method.\nIn this new implementation, it covers lines 1-5, or 56\\frac{5}{6}​6​​5​​ lines.\nThe line coverage went up from 60%60\\%60% to 83%83\\%83%, \nwhile testing the same method with the same input.\nThis urges for a better representation of source code. One that is \nindependent of the developers' personal code styles.\nSome coverage tools measure coverage at statement level. Statements are the unique instructions that your\nJVM, for example, executes. This is a bit better, as splitting one line of code in two would not make a difference, but it is still not good enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlocks and Control-Flow Graph\nA control-flow graph (or CFG) is a representation of all paths that might be traversed during the execution of a piece of code. \nIt consists of basic blocks, decision blocks, and arrows/edges that connect these blocks.\nLet us use the Black Jack implementation to illustrate the difference between them:\npublic class BlackJack {\n  public int play(int left, int right) {\n1.  int ln = left;\n2.  int rn = right;\n3.  if (ln > 21)\n4.    ln = 0;\n5.  if (rn > 21)\n6.    rn = 0;\n7.  if (ln > rn)\n8.    return ln;\n9.  else\n10.   return rn;\n  }\n}\n\nA basic block is composed of \"the maximum number of statements that are executed together no matter what happens\". In the code above, lines 1-2 are always executed together. Basic blocks are often represented by a square.\nAt this moment, our control-flow graph looks like the following:\n\nA decision block, on the other hand, represents all the statements in the source\ncode that can create different branches. See line 3: if (ln > 21). This if\nstatement creates a decision moment in the application: based on the condition, it is decided which code block will be executed next. Decision blocks are often represented by diamonds. This decision block happens right \nafter the basic block we created above, and thus, they are connected by means of\nan edge.\n\nA basic block has always a single outgoing edge. A decision block, \non the other hand, always has\ntwo outgoing edges (indicating where you go in case of the decision being evaluated to true, and where you go in case the decision is evaluated to false).\nIn case of the decision block being evaluated to true, line 4 is executed, and the\nprogram continues to line 5.\nOtherwise, it proceeds straight to line 5, which is another decision block:\n\nWhen you repeat the approach up to the end of the program, you end up with the\nfollowing CFG:\n\nLet us see an example of a more complex CFG:\n\nRequirement: Counting words\nGiven a sentence, the program should count the number of words \nthat end with either an \"s\" or an \"r\".\nA word ends when a non-letter appears.\n\nA possible implementation for this program is:\npublic class CountLetters {\n  public int count(String str) {\n1.  int words = 0;\n2.  char last = ' ';\n3.  for (int i = 0; i \nThe corresponding CFG:\n\nNote that we split the for loop into three blocks: the variable initialisation, the decision block, and the increment.\nAs you can see, this CFG representation is quite generic. Even when you use a different programming language to write the same program, you might end up with the same CFG.\nBlock coverage\nWe can use the control-flow graph to derive tests.\nA first idea would be to use blocks as a coverage criterion, in the same way we did with lines, but instead of aiming at covering\n100% of the lines, we aim at covering 100% of the blocks.\nThe formula that measures block coverage is similar to\nthe line coverage formula:\nblock coverage=blocks coveredblocks total⋅100%\\text{block coverage} = \\frac{\\text{blocks covered}}{\\text{blocks total}} \\cdot 100\\%block coverage=​blocks total​​blocks covered​​⋅100%\nNote that blocks do not depend on how the developer wrote the code. Thus, it does not suffer from\nhaving different coverage numbers due to different\nprogramming styles.\nFor the CountLetters program, a test T1 = \"cats and dogs\" exercises all the blocks, and thus,\nreaches 100% block coverage (follow the input in the control-flow graph and see all the blocks being executed):\n@Test\nvoid multipleWords() {\n  int words = new CountLetters().count(\"cats|dogs\");\n  assertEquals(2, words);\n}\n\nBranch/Decision coverage\nComplex programs often rely on lots of complex conditions (e.g., if statements composed of many conditions).\nWhen testing these programs, aiming at 100% line or block coverage might not be enough to cover all the cases we want.\nWe need a stronger criterion.\nBranch coverage (or decision coverage) works similar to line and statement coverage, except with branch coverage we count (or aim at covering) all the possible decision outcomes.\nA test suite will achieve 100% branch (or decision) coverage when tests exercise all the possible outcomes of decision blocks:\nbranch coverage=decision outcomes covereddecision outcomes total⋅100%\\text{branch coverage} = \\frac{\\text{decision outcomes covered}}{\\text{decision outcomes total}} \\cdot 100\\%branch coverage=​decision outcomes total​​decision outcomes covered​​⋅100%\nDecisions (or branches) are easy to identify in a CFG. \nArrows with either true or false (i.e., both the arrows going out of a decision block) are branches, and therefore must be exercised.\nLet's aim at 100% branch coverage for the Count Letter's count implementation above: \npublic class CountLettersTests {\n  @Test\n  void multipleMatchingWords() {\n\n    int words = new CountLetters()\n        .count(\"cats|dogs\");\n\n    assertEquals(2, words);\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  void lastWordDoesntMatch() {\n\n    int words = new CountLetters()\n        .count(\"cats|dog\");\n\n    assertEquals(1, words);\n  }\n}\n\n\nThe first test (by providing cats|dogs as input) covers all the branches in the left part of the CFG.\nThe right part covers the top false branch, because at some point i will be equal to str.length().\nThe word \"dogs\" ends with an 's', so it also covers the true branch on the right side of the CFG.\nThis gives the test 56⋅100%=83%\\frac{5}{6} \\cdot 100\\% = 83\\%​6​​5​​⋅100%=83% branch coverage.\n\nThe only branch that is now not covered is the false branch at the bottom right of the CFG.\nThis branch is executed when the last word does not end with an 'r' or an 's'.\nThe second test executes this branch, by providing the string cats|dog as input. Thus, the two tests together achieve a branch/decision coverage of 100%100\\%100%.\n\n\nIn the video, we use squares to represent decision blocks. We did it just because otherwise the control-flow graph would not fit in the video. When doing control-flow graphs, please use diamonds to represent decision blocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Basic) condition coverage\nBranch coverage gives two branches for each decision, no matter how complicated or complex the decision is.\nWhen a decision gets complicated, i.e., it contains more than one condition like a > 10 && b , \nbranch coverage might not be enough to test all the possible outcomes of all these decisions. \nFor example, suppose one aims at testing the decision above.\nA test T1 (a=20, b=10, c=5), which makes the condition true, and a test T2 (a=5, b=10, c=5), which makes the condition false, already fully cover this decision block, in terms of branch coverage. \nHowever, these two tests do not cover all the\npossibilities/different combinations for this decision to be evaluated to false; e.g., T3 (a=20, b=30, c=5), etc.\nWhen using condition coverage as a criterion, we split each compound condition into multiple decision blocks. This means each of the conditions will be tested separately, and not only the \"big decision block\".\nIt is common to then re-design the CFG and make sure each decision block is now composed of a single condition.\nWith the new CFG in hands (and with it new edges to explore), it works the same as branch coverage. The formula is basically the same, but now there are more decision outcomes to count:\ncondition coverage=conditions outcome coveredconditions outcome total⋅100%\\text{condition coverage} = \\frac{\\text{conditions outcome covered}}{\\text{conditions outcome total}} \\cdot 100\\%condition coverage=​conditions outcome total​​conditions outcome covered​​⋅100%\nWe achieve 100% condition coverage when all of the outcomes of\nall the conditions in our program have been exercised.\nIn other words, whenever all the conditions have been true and false at least once.\nOnce again we look at the program that counts the words ending with an 'r or an 's'. Let us now focus on achieving 100% (basic) condition coverage.\nWe start by building a more granular CFG:\n\nYou can see that this new CFG has more decision blocks than the previous one (six instead of three).\nThe multipleMatchingWords test now covers 7 out of 12 different decision outcomes.\nCondition coverage is thus 712⋅100%=58%\\frac{7}{12} \\cdot 100\\% = 58\\%​12​​7​​⋅100%=58%.\nThis is significantly less than the 83%83\\%83% branch coverage that we obtain from the same multipleMatchingWords test, \nshowing how many more tests one would need \nto achieve 100% condition coverage.\nCondition + Branch coverage\nLet's think carefully about condition coverage. If we only focus on exercising the individual conditions themselves, but do not\nthink of the overall decision, we might end up in a situation like the one below.\nImagine the following program and its respective CFG:\nvoid hello(int a, int b) {\n  if(a > 10 && b > 20) {\n    System.out.println(\"Hello\");\n  } else {\n    System.out.println(\"Hi\");\n  }\n}\n\n\nA test T1 = (20, 10) causes the first condition a > 10 to be true, and the\nsecond condition b > 20 to be false. A test T2 = (5, 30) makes the first condition false, and the second condition true. Note that T1 and T2 together achieve 100% basic condition coverage. After all, both conditions a and b have been exercised as both true and false. \nHowever, the final outcome of the entire decision was false in both tests. We never saw this program printing \"Hello\". We found a case where\nwe achieved 100% basic condition coverage, but only 50% branch coverage. This is not a smart testing strategy. This is why looking only at the conditions themselves while ignoring the overall outcome of the decision block is called\nbasic condition coverage.\nIn practice, whenever we use condition coverage, we actually perform branch + condition coverage. In other words, we make sure\nthat we achieve 100% condition coverage (i.e., all the outcomes of all conditions are exercised) and 100% branch coverage (all the outcomes\nof the compound decisions are exercised).\nThe formula to calculate branch+condition coverage might vary among tools. Some consider the same as in condition coverage:\nC/DC coverage=conditions outcome coveredconditions outcome total⋅100%\\text{C/DC coverage} = \\frac{\\text{conditions outcome covered}}{\\text{conditions outcome total}} \\cdot 100\\%C/DC coverage=​conditions outcome total​​conditions outcome covered​​⋅100%\nOthers prefer to count, for each decision block, the number of outcomes per condition plus the number of outcomes per decision. For example, an if(a>10 && b  would count as 6, as 2 for the a>10 condition, 2 for the b condition, and 2 for the a>10 && b. This formula would give us a clear differentiation between basic condition and decision+condition coverage:\nC/DC coverage=conditions outcome covered + decisions outcome coveredconditions outcome total + decisions outcome total⋅100%\\text{C/DC coverage} = \\frac{\\text{conditions outcome covered + decisions outcome covered}}{\\text{conditions outcome total + decisions outcome total}} \\cdot 100\\%C/DC coverage=​conditions outcome total + decisions outcome total​​conditions outcome covered + decisions outcome covered​​⋅100%\nFrom now on, whenever we mention condition coverage, we mean condition + branch coverage.\nAnother common criterion is the Multiple Condition Coverage, or MCC. To satisfy the MCC criterion, a condition needs to be exercised in all its possible combinations. That would imply in \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPath coverage\nWith branch+condition coverage, we looked at each condition and branch individually. Such a criterion gives testers more branches to generate tests, especially when compared to the first criterion we discussed (line coverage).\nHowever, although we are testing each condition to be evaluated as true and false, this does not ensure testing of all the paths that a program can have.\nPath coverage does not consider the conditions individually. Rather, it considers the (full) combination of the conditions in a decision.\nEach of these combinations is a path. You might see a path as a unique way to traverse the CFG.\nThe calculation is the same as the other coverages: \npath coverage=paths coveredpaths total⋅100%\\text{path coverage} = \\frac{\\text{paths covered}}{\\text{paths total}} \\cdot 100\\%path coverage=​paths total​​paths covered​​⋅100%\nSee the following example that focus on a small piece of the count method:\nif (!Character.isLetter(str.charAt(i)) \n        & (last == 's' | last == 'r')) {\n    words++;\n}\n\nThe decision in this if-statement contains three conditions and can be generalised to (A & (B | C)), with:\n\nA = !Character.isLetter(str.charAt(i))\nB = last == 's'\nC = last == 'r'\n\nTo get 100%100\\%100% path coverage, we would have to test all the possible combinations of these three conditions.\nWe make a truth table to find the combinations:\n\n\n\nTests\nA\nB\nC\nOutcome\n\n\n\n\n1\nT\nT\nT\nT\n\n\n2\nT\nT\nF\nT\n\n\n3\nT\nF\nT\nT\n\n\n4\nT\nF\nF\nF\n\n\n5\nF\nT\nT\nF\n\n\n6\nF\nT\nF\nF\n\n\n7\nF\nF\nT\nF\n\n\n8\nF\nF\nF\nF\n\n\n\nThis means that, for full path coverage, we would need 8 tests just to cover this if statement.\nIt is a large number for just a single statement. \nWhile this seems similar to the MCC criterion we quickly discussed above, imagine programs that rely on loops:\nboolean shouldRun = true;\nwhile(shouldRun) {\n  something();\n  something2();\n\n  shouldRun = something3();\n}\n\nTo satisfy all the criteria we studied so far, we would need to exercise the shouldRun as being true and false. That does not happen with path coverage. To satisfy path coverage, we would need to test all the possible paths that can happen. The unbounded loop might make this program to iterate an infinite number of times. Imagine now a program with two unbounded loops together. How many different possible paths does this program have?\nBy aiming at achieving path coverage of our program, testers can indeed come up with good tests.\nHowever, the main issue is that achieving 100% path coverage might not always be feasible or too costly.\nThe number of tests needed for full path coverage will grow exponentially with the number of conditions in a decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nLazy vs eager operators (and how they affect test case design)\nNote that we have been avoiding lazy (short-circuit) operators (i.e., && and ||), on purpose, to make sure all conditions of the expression are evaluated. This allows us to devise test cases for each possible combination we see in the decision table. However, that might not be the case if we use lazy operators. Let's take as an example the same expression, but now using lazy operators: (A && (B || C))\nWe make the truth table to find the combinations:\n\n\n\nTests\nA\nB\nC\nOutcome\n\n\n\n\n1\nT\nT\ndc\nT\n\n\n2\nT\nF\nT\nT\n\n\n3\nT\nF\nF\nF\n\n\n4\nF\nX\ndc\nF\n\n\n\n('dc' represents \"don't care\" values.)\nFor this particular example, if the A is false, then the rest of the expression will be not evaluated anymore, because the result of the entire statement will be automatically false. Moreover, for the second part of the expression, if B is true, then the entire proposition (B || C) is already true, so we \"don't care\" about the value of the C.\nGenerically speaking, it might be not possible to devise test cases for all the combinations. As a tester, you just have to take such constraints into consideration.\nLoop boundary adequacy\nThe section raised an interesting problem:\nin terms of coverage criteria, what to do when we have loops? When there is a loop, the block inside of the loop might be executed many times, making testing more complicated.\nThink of a while(true) loop which can be non-terminating. If we wanted to be rigorous about it, we would have to test the program where the loop block is executed one time, two times, three times, etc. Imagine a for(i = 0; i  loop with a break inside of the body. We would have to test what happens if the loop body executes one time, two times, three times, ..., up to ten times.\nIt might be impossible to exhaustively test all the combinations.\nHow can we handle long-lasting loops (a loop that runs for many iterations), or unbounded loops (where we do not know how many times it will be executed)? \nGiven that exhaustive testing is impossible,\ntesters often rely on the loop boundary adequacy criterion\nto decide when to stop testing a loop. A test suite satisfies this criterion if and only if for every loop:\n\nA test case exercises the loop zero times;\nA test case exercises the loop once;\nA test case exercises the loop multiple times.\n\nThe idea behind the criterion is to make sure the program\nis tested when the loop is never executed (does the program\nbehave correctly when the loop is simply 'skipped'?), when it only iterates once (as we empirically know that algorithms may not handle single cases correctly), and many times.\nPragmatically speaking, the main challenge comes when devising\nthe test case for the loop being executed multiple times.\nShould the test case force the loop to iterate for 2, 5, or 10 times?\nThat requires a good understanding of the program/requirement itself. \nOur suggestion for testers is to rely on specification-based techniques. With an optimal understanding of the specs, one should be able to devise good tests for the particular loop.\nMC/DC (Modified Condition/Decision Coverage)\nModified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC) looks at the combinations of conditions like path coverage does.\nHowever, instead of aiming at testing all the possible combinations, we follow a process in order to identify the \"important\" combinations. The goal of focusing on these important combinations is to manage the large number of test cases that one needs to devise when aiming for 100% path coverage.\nThe idea of MC/DC is to exercise each condition \nin a way that it can, independently of the other conditions,\naffect the outcome of the entire decision. \nIn short, this means that every possible condition of each parameter must have influenced the outcome at least once.\nIf we take the decision block from path coverage example, A && (B || C), MC/DC dictates that:\n\nFor condition A:\nThere must be one test case where A=true (say T1). \nThere must be one test case where A=false (say T2).\nT1 and T2 (which we call independence pairs) must have different outcomes (e.g., T1 makes the entire decision to evaluate to true, and T2 makes the entire decision to evaluate to false, or the other way around).\nIn both test cases T1 and T2, variables B and C should be the same.\n\n\nFor condition B:\nThere must be one test case where B=true (say T3). \nThere must be one test case where B=false (say T4).\nT3 and T4 have different outcomes.\nIn both test cases T3 and T4, variables A and C should be the same.\n\n\nFor condition C:\nThere must be one test case where C=true (say T5). \nThere must be one test case where C=false (say T6).\nT3 and T4 have different outcomes,\nIn both test cases T3 and T4, variables A and B should be the same.\n\n\n\nCost-wise, a relevant characteristic of MC/DC coverage is that, supposing that conditions only have binary outcomes (i.e., true or false), the number of tests required to achieve 100% MC/DC coverage is, on average, N+1N+1N+1, where NNN is the number of conditions in the decision. \nNote that N+1N+1N+1 is definitely smaller than 2N2^N2​N​​!\nAgain, to devise a test suite that achieves 100% MC/DC coverage, we should devise N+1N+1N+1 test cases that, when combined, \nexercise all the combinations independently from the others.\nThe question is how to select such test cases. See the example below.\nImagine a program that decides whether an applicant should be admitted to the 'University of Character':\nvoid admission(boolean degree, boolean experience, boolean character) {\n    if (character && (degree || experience)) {\n        System.out.println(\"Admitted\");\n    } else {\n        System.out.println(\"Rejected\");\n    }\n}\n\nThe program takes three booleans as input (which, generically speaking, is the same as the A && (B || C) we just discussed): \n\nWhether the applicant has a good character (true or false),\nWhether the applicant has a degree (true or false),\nWhether the applicant has experience in a field of work (true or false).\n\nIf the applicant has good character and either a degree or experience in the field, he/she will be admitted.\nIn any other case the applicant will be rejected.\nTo test this program, we first use the truth table for A && (B || C) to see all the combinations and their outcomes.\nIn this case, we have 3 decisions and 232^32​3​​ is 8, therefore we have tests that go from 1 to 8:\n\n\n\nTests\nCharacter\nDegree\nExperience\nDecision\n\n\n\n\n1\nT\nT\nT\nT\n\n\n2\nT\nT\nF\nT\n\n\n3\nT\nF\nT\nT\n\n\n4\nT\nF\nF\nF\n\n\n5\nF\nT\nT\nF\n\n\n6\nF\nT\nF\nF\n\n\n7\nF\nF\nT\nF\n\n\n8\nF\nF\nF\nF\n\n\n\nOur goal will be to apply the MC/DC criterion to these test cases,\nand select N+1N+1N+1, in this case 3+1=43+1=43+1=4, tests.\nIn this case, the 4 four tests that satisfy that MC/DC coverage is {2, 3, 4, 6}.\nHow did we find them?\nWe go test by test, condition by condition.\nWe start with selecting the pairs of combinations (or tests) for the Character parameter.\n\nIn test 1, we see that Character, Degree, and Experience are all true and the Decision (i.e., the outcome of the entire boolean expression) is also true. We now look for another test in this table, where only the value of Character is the opposite of the value in test 1,\nbut the others (Degree and Experience) are still the same. This means we have to look for a test where Character = false, Degree = true, Experience = true, and Decision = false. This combination appears in test 5. \nThus, we just found a pair of tests (again, called independence pairs), T1T_1T​1​​ and T5T_5T​5​​, where Character is the only parameter which changed and the outcome (Decision) changed as well.\nIn other words, a pair of tests where the Character independently influences the outcome (Decision). Let's keep the pair {T1,T5}\\{T_1, T_5\\}{T​1​​,T​5​​} in our list of test cases.\n\nWe could have stopped here and moved to the next variable. After all, we already found an independence pair for Character. However, finding them all might help us in reducing the number of test cases at the end, as you will see. So let us continue and we look at the next test. In test 2, Character = true, Degree = true, Experience = false, and Decision = true. We repeat the process and search for a test where Character is the opposite of the value in test 2, but Degree and Experience remain the same (Degree = true, Experience = false). This set appears in test 6.\n  This means we just found another pair of tests, T2T_2T​2​​ and T6T_6T​6​​, where Character is the only parameter which changed and the outcome (Decision) changed as well.\n\nAgain, we repeat the process for test 3 (Character = true, Degree = false, Experience = true) and find that the Character parameter in test 7 (Character = false, Degree = false, Experience = true) is the opposite of the value in test 3 and changes the outcome (Decision). \n\nFor test 4 (Character = true, Degree = false, Experience = false). Its pair is test 8 (Character = false, Degree = false, Experience = false). Now, the outcome of both tests is the same (Decision = false). This means that the pair {T4,T8}\\{T_4, T_8\\}{T​4​​,T​8​​} does not show how Character can independently affect the overall outcome; after all, Character is the only thing that changes in these two tests, but the outcome is still the same.\n\n\nAs we do not find another suitable pair when repeating the process for tests 5, 6, 7 and 8, we move on from the Character parameter to the Degree parameter. We repeat the same process, but now we search for the opposite value of parameter Degree whilst Character and Experience stay the same.\n\nFor test 1 (Charater = true, Degree = true, Experience = true), we search for a test where (Charater = true, Degree = false, Experience = true). This appears to be the case in test 3. However, the outcome for both test cases stay the same. Therefore, {T1,T3}\\{T_1, T_3\\}{T​1​​,T​3​​} does not show how the Degree parameter can independently affect the outcome.\n\nAfter repeating all the steps for the other tests we find only {T2,T4}\\{T_2, T_4\\}{T​2​​,T​4​​} to have different values for the Degree parameter where the outcome also changes.\n\nFinally we move to the Experience parameter. As with the Degree parameter, there is only one pair of combinations that will work, which is {T3,T4}\\{T_3, T_4\\}{T​3​​,T​4​​}. \n\n\nWe highly recommend carrying out the entire process yourself to get a feeling of how the process works!\nWe now have all the pairs for each of the parameters:\n\nCharacter: {1, 5}, {2, 6}, {3, 7}\nDegree: {2, 4}\nExperience: {3, 4}\n\nHaving a single independence pair per variable (Character, Degree and Experience) is enough. After all, we want to minimise the total number of tests, and we know that we can\nachieve this with N+1N+1N+1 tests.\nWe do not have any choices with conditions Degree and Experience, as we found only one pair of tests for each parameter.\nThis means that we have to test combinations 2, 3 and 4.\nLastly, we need to find the appropriate pair of A. Note that any\nof them would fit. However, we want to reduce the total amount\nof tests in the test suite (and again, we know we only need 4 in this case).\nIf we were to pick either test 1 or test 5 we would have to include either test 5 or test 1 as well, \nas they are their opposites, but therefore unneccesarily increasing our number of tests.\nIn order to keep our test cases in accordance to N+1N+1N+1 or in this case 3+13+13+1, thus 4 test cases we can \neither add test 6 or test 7, as their opposites (test 2 or 3) are already included in our test cases.\nRandomly, we pick test 6.\nYou can indeed have more than one set of tests that achieve 100% MC/DC. All solutions are equally acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the tests that we need for 100% MC/DC coverage are {2, 3, 4, 6}.\nThese are the only 4 tests we need. This is indeed cheaper when compare to the 8 tests we would need for path coverage.\nLet us now discuss some details about the MC/DC coverage:\n\nWe have applied what we call unique-cause MC/DC criteria. We identify an independence pair (T1, T2), where only a single condition changes between T1 and T2, as well as the final outcome. That might not be possible in all cases. For example, (A and B) or (A and C). Ideally, we would demonstrate the independence of the first A, B, the second A, and C. It is however impossible to change the first A and not change the second A. Thus, we can not demonstrate the independence of each A in the expression. In such cases, we then allow A to vary, but we still fix all other variables (this is what is called masked MC/DC).\n\nIt might not be possible to achieve MC/DC coverage in some expressions. See (A and B) or (A and not B). While the independence pairs (TT, FT) would show the independence of A, there are no pairs that show the independence of B. While logically possible, in such cases, we recommend the developer to revisit the (degenerative) expression as it might had been poorly designed. In our example, the expression could be reformulated to simply A.\n\nMathematically speaking, N+1N+1N+1 is the minimum number of tests required for MC/DC coverage (and 2∗N2 * N2∗N the theoretical upper bound). However, empirical studies indeed show that N+1N+1N+1 is often the required number of tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria subsumption\nYou might have noticed that the criteria we studied became more rigorous and demanding throughout this chapter. We started our discussion with line coverage. Then we discussed branch coverage, and we noticed that we could generate more tests if we focused on branches. Then, we discussed branch + condition coverage, and we noticed that we could generate even more tests, if we also focused on the conditions.\nThere is a relationship between these criteria. Some strategies subsume other strategies. \nFormally, a strategy X subsumes strategy Y if all elements that Y exercises are also exercised by X. You can see in the figure below the relationship between the coverage criteria we studied.\n\nFor example, in the picture, one can see that branch coverage subsumes line coverage. This means that 100% of branch coverage always implies 100% line coverage. However, 100% line coverage does not imply 100% branch coverage. Moreover, 100% of branch + condition coverage always implies 100% branch coverage and 100% line coverage.\nMore examples of Control-Flow Graphs\nWe can devise control-flow graphs for programs in any programming language. For example, see the piece of\nPython code below:\n# random_ads is a list of ads.\n# an ad contains three attributes:\n# * available: true/false indicating whether the ad \n#   is still available.\n# * reached: true/false indicating \n#   whether the number of paid prints was reached.\n# * prints: an integer indicating the \n#   number of times that the ad was printed.\ndef validate_ads(random_ads):\n01. valid_ads = []\n02. invalid_ads = []\n\n03. for random_ad in random_ads:\n04.   if random_ad.available and not random_ad.reached:\n05.     valid_ads.append(random_ad)\n06.   else:\n07.     invalid_ads.append(random_ad)\n\n08. for valid_ad in valid_ads:\n09.   valid_ad.prints += 1\n\n10. return valid_ads, invalid_ads\n\nA CFG for this piece of code would look like:\n\nWe applied the same idea we have seen for Java programs in a Python program. The notions of basic and decision blocks are the same. A small difference to note is in the foreach loop (which is simply written using the for keyword in Python). Given that foreach loops do not follow the same format as traditional for loops, we modelled it differently: the foreach loop is fully represented by a single decision block (i.e., no blocks for the increment, or condition). As with any decision blocks, it has two outcomes, true and false.\nThe effectiveness of structural testing\nA common question among practitioners is whether\nstructural testing or, in their words, test coverage,\nmatters.\nWhile researchers have not yet found a magical coverage\nnumber that one should aim for, they have been finding\ninteresting evidence pointing towards the benefits\nof performing structural testing.\nWe quote two of these studies:\n\nHutchins et al.: \"Within the limited domain of our experiments, test sets achieving coverage levels over 90% usually showed significantly better fault detection than randomly chosen test sets of the same size. In addition, significant improvements in the effectiveness of coverage-based tests usually occurred as coverage increased from 90% to 100%. However, the results also indicate that 100% code coverage alone is not a reliable indicator of the effectiveness of a test set.\"\nNamin and Andrews: \"Our experiments indicate that coverage is sometimes correlated with effectiveness when [test suite] size is controlled for, and that using both size and coverage yields a more accurate prediction of effectiveness than [test suite] size alone. This in turn suggests that both size and coverage are important to test suite effectiveness.\"\n\nFor interested readers, an extensive literature review on the topic can be found in\nZhu, H., Hall, P. A., & May, J. H. (1997). Software unit test coverage and adequacy. ACM computing surveys (csur), 29(4), 366-427.\nStructural testing vs structural coverage\nA common misconception among practitioners to confuse structural testing with structural coverage.\nStructural testing means leveraging the structure of the source code to systematically exercise the system under test. When compared to specification-based testing, we note that structural testing is: \n\nMore objective. In other words, it does not depend on the opinions and experience of the tester. While different testers might come up with different specification-based tests, they would come with similar structural tests.\n\nImplementation-aware. Implementations can vary from the specifications. After all, there are so many ways one can implement a program. Structural testing enables testers to explore the precise implementation.\n\n\nOn the other hand, structural testing is a check and balance (as Chilenski puts it) on the specification-based tests. Structural testing confirms and complements the tests that we derived before.\nIt is common to see developers running their coverage tools and writing tests for the outputs they observe. Developers that are mostly focused on (simply) achieving high structural coverage are missing the main point of structural testing. \nAgain, structural testing should complement your requirements-based testing. As Chilenski suggests (see Figure 3 in his paper), the first step of a tester should be to derive test cases out of any requirements-based technique. Once requirements are fully covered, testers then perform structural testing to cover what is missing from the structural-point of view. Any divergences should be brought back to the requirements-based testing phase: why did we not find this class/partition before? Once requirements and structure are covered, one can consider the testing phase done.\nTherefore, do not aim at 100% coverage. Use structural testing to complement your specification-based tests.\nExercises\nFor the first couple of exercises we will use the following code:\npublic boolean remove(Object o) {\n01.  if (o == null) {\n02.    for (Node x = first; x != null; x = x.next) {\n03.      if (x.item == null) {\n04.        unlink(x);\n05.        return true;\n         }\n       }\n06.  } else {\n07.    for (Node x = first; x != null; x = x.next) {\n08.      if (o.equals(x.item)) {\n09.        unlink(x);\n10.        return true;\n         }\n       }\n     }\n11.  return false;\n}\n\nThis is the implementation of JDK8's LinkedList remove method.

A model gives us a structured way to understand how the program operates (or should operate).\nModel-based testing makes use of models of the system to derive tests.\nIn this chapter, we show what a model is (or can be) and go over some of the models used in software testing.\nThe two models covered in this chapter are decision tables and state machines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision Tables\nDecision tables are used to model how a combination of conditions should lead to a certain action.\nThese tables are easy to understand and can be validated by the client for whom the software is created.\nDevelopers can use the decision tables to derive tests that verify the correct implementation of the requirements with respect to the conditions.\nCreating decision tables\nA decision table is a table containing the conditions and the actions performed by the system based on these conditions. In this section, we discuss how to build them.\nIn general, a decision table looks like the following:\n\n  Variants\n  Conditions\n  TTFF\n  TFTF\n  Actionvalue1value2value3value4\n\n\nThis table contains all the combinations of conditions explicitly.\nLater we will look at ways to reduce the number of combinations in the table and in this way reduce the cost of testing all the combinations.\nThe selected conditions should always be independent of each other.\nAlso, in this type of decision table, the order of the conditions does not matter, e.g., making  true and  false or making  false and after that  true, should result in the same outcome.\n(If the order does matter in some way, a state machine might be a better model. We cover state machines later in this chapter.)\nLet us devise a first concrete decision table for an example program.\n\nRequirement: Phone Subscription\nWhen choosing a phone subscription, there are a couple of options you could choose.\nDepending on these options a price per month is given.\nWe consider the two options: international services and automatic renewal.\nInternational services increase the price per month.\nAutomatic renewal decreases the price per month.\n\nIn the decision table, international services and\nautomatic renewal will be turned into conditions.\nTrue then corresponds to a chosen option and false\ncorresponds to an option that is not chosen.\nThe decision table is as follows:\n\n  Variants\n  Conditions\n  InternationalTTFF\n  Auto-renewalTFTF\n  Actionprice/month30321015\n\n\nYou can see the different prices for the combinations of international services and automatic renewal.\nDon't care values: In some cases, the value of a condition might not influence the action.\nThis is represented as a \"don't care\" value, or \"dc\".\nEssentially, \"dc\" is a combination of two columns.\nThese two columns have the same values for the conditions and the same result, except the condition that had the dc value which has different values in the expanded form.\nIf the decision table is as follows:\n\n  Variants\n  Conditions\n  TdcF\n  dcTF\n  Actionvalue1value1value2\n\n\nIt can be expanded to:\n\n  Variants\n  Conditions\n  TTTFF\n  TFTTF\n  Actionvalue1value1value1value1value2\n\n\nAfter expanding we can remove the duplicate columns.\nWe end up with the decision table below:\n\n  Variants\n  Conditions\n  TTFF\n  TFTF\n  Actionvalue1value1value1value2\n\n\nLet us now go back to the Phone Subscription example, and add another condition to it:\n\nA loyal customer receives the same discount as a\ncustomer who chooses the automatic renewal option.\nHowever, a customer is only entitled to the discount from one of the two options.\n\nThe new decision table is below:\n\n  Variants\n  Conditions\n  InternationalFFFTTT\n  Auto-renewalTdcFTdcF\n  LoyaldcTFdcTF\n  Actionprice / month101015303032\n\n\nNote that when automatic renewal is true, the loyalty condition does not change the outcome and vice versa.\nDefault behaviour: Usually, NNN conditions lead to 2N2^N2​N​​ combinations or columns.\nHowever, the number of columns that are specified in the decision table can be smaller. Even if we expand all the dc values.\nThis is achieved by using a default action.\nA default action means that if a combination of condition outcomes is not present in the decision table, the default action should be the result.\nIf we set the default charge rate to 10 per month the new decision table can be a bit smaller:\n\n  Variants\n  Conditions\n  InternationalFTTT\n  Auto-renewalFTdcF\n  LoyalFdcTF\n  Actionprice / month15303032\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting decision tables\nWe can derive tests based on the decision tables, in such a way that we test whether the expected logic is implemented correctly.\nThere are multiple ways to derive tests for a decision table:\n\nAll explicit variants: Derive a test case for each column. The number of tests equals the number of columns in the decision table.\nAll possible variants: Derive a test case for each possible combination of condition values. For NNN conditions this leads to 2N2^N2​N​​ test cases. Often, this approach is unrealistic because of the exponential relationship between the number of conditions and the number of test cases.\nEvery unique outcome / All decisions: One test case for each unique outcome or action. The number of tests depends on the actions in the decision table.\nEach condition T/F: Make sure that each condition is true and false at least once in the test suite. This often results in two tests: all conditions true and all conditions false.\n\nOne more way to derive test cases from a decision table is by using the Modified Condition / Decision Coverage (MC/DC).\nThis is a combination of the last two ways of deriving tests demonstrated above.\nWe have already discussed MC/DC in the Structural-Based Testing chapter.\nMC/DC has the two characteristics of All decisions and Each condition T/F with an additional characteristic that makes MC/DC special:\n\nEach condition is at least once true and once false in the test suite;\nEach unique action should be tested at least once;\nEach condition should individually determine the action or outcome.\n\nThe third point is achieved by making two test cases for each condition.\nIn these two test cases, the condition being tested should have a different value, the outcome should be different, and the other conditions should have the same value in both test cases.\nWith this the condition that is being tested individually influences the outcome, as the other conditions stay the same and therefore do not influence the outcome.\nBy choosing the test cases efficiently, MC/DC needs fewer tests than all variants, while still exercising the important parts of the system.\nWith fewer tests it will take less time to write the tests and the test suite will be executed quicker.\nIn order to derive the tests, we expand and rearrange the decision table of the Phone Subscription example as follows:\n\n  v1v2v3v4v5v6v7v8\n  Conditions\n  InternationalTTTTFFFF\n  Auto-renewalTTFFTTFF\n  LoyalTFTFTFTF\n  Actionprice / month3030303210101015\n\n\nFirst, we look at the first condition (v1) and we try to find pairs of combinations that would cover this condition according to MC/DC.\nWe look for combinations where only International Services and the price/month change.\nThe possible pairs are: {v1, v5}, {v2, v6}, {v3, v7} and {v4, v8}.\n\nTesting both of the combinations in any of these pairs would give MC/DC for the first condition.\nThen with Automatic Renewal we find these pairs: {v2, v4}, {v6, v8}.\nFor this condition {v1, v3} and {v5, v7} are not viable pairs, because both combinations of each pair involve the same action.\nThe last condition, Loyal, gives the following pairs: {v3, v4}, {v7, v8}.\nBy choosing the test cases efficiently we should be able to achieve full MC/DC by choosing four of the combinations.\nWe want to cover all the actions in the test suite.\nTherefore, we need at least v4 and v8.\nWith these decisions we also have covered the International Services condition.\nWe need one of v1, v2, v3 and one of v5, v6, v7.\nTo cover Loyal, we add v7 and to cover Automatic Renewal we add v2.\nAll the possible actions have now been covered.\nFor full MC/DC, we test the decisions: v2, v4, v7, v8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementing automated test cases for decision tables\nNow that we know how to derive the test cases from the decision tables, it is time to implement them as automated test cases.\nThe most obvious way to test the combinations is to create a single test for each of the conditions.\nLet us continue with the example for which we created the decision table earlier.\nWe write the tests for combinations v2 and v3.\nAssuming that we can use some implemented methods in a PhonePlan class, the tests look like this:\n@Test\npublic void internationalAutoRenewalTest() {\n  PhonePlan plan = new PhonePlan();\n\n  plan.setInternational(true);\n  plan.setAutoRenewal(true);\n  plan.setLoyal(false);\n\n  assertEquals(30, plan.pricePerMonth());\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void internationalLoyalTest() {\n  PhonePlan plan = new PhonePlan();\n\n  plan.setInternational(true);\n  plan.setAutoRenewal(false);\n  plan.setLoyal(true);\n\n  assertEquals(30, plan.pricePerMonth());\n}\n\nNote that, in order to improve readability, we use setters to define whether a plan is for international services, automatic renewal or loyalty. The best way of designing the PhonePlan class would be to receive such parameters in the constructor.\nThis would force all clients of the class to provide these configurations at the moment of instantiation, preventing instances of PhonePlan to be in an inconsistent state.\nWe discuss more about such contracts in the design-by-contracts chapter.\n\nIn the example above, it should be noted that the different tests for the different combinations are similar.\nThe tests are the same but they operate on different values.\nTo avoid the code duplication that comes with this approach to implementing decision table tests, we can use parameterised tests (as we have done before):\n@ParameterizedTest\n@CsvSource({\n  \"true, true, false, 30\",   // v2\n  \"true, false, true, 30\",   // v3\n  \"true, false, false, 32\",  // v4\n  \"false, false, false, 15\"  // v8\n})\npublic void pricePerMonthTest(boolean international, boolean autoRenewal,\n    boolean loyal, int price) {\n\n  PhonePlan plan = new PhonePlan();\n\n  plan.setInternational(international);\n  plan.setAutoRenewal(autoRenewal);\n  plan.setLoyal(loyal);\n\n  assertEquals(price, plan.pricePerMonth());\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-binary choices and final guidelines\nSo far, all the decision tables we have discussed have boolean conditions (i.e., values in the cells were either true or false).\nThe decision tables can be generalized to contain non-boolean values (non-binary choices). In other words, instead of only true and false, the values can now also be, e.g., a number.\nTake the decision table for the phone subscriptions, discussed earlier.\nInitially, this only contained the international and auto-renewal conditions.\nA non-boolean can be introduced to represent a data limit.\nThe amount of data can be unlimited (∞), 8 GB, or none (0 GB).\n\n  Variants\n  Conditions\n  InternationalTTFFFF\n  Auto-renewalTFTTFF\n  Data limit∞∞8080\n  Actionprice / month323012101715\n\n\nWith two boolean conditions and one condition with three possible values, the possible number of variants is 2⋅2⋅3=122 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 122⋅2⋅3=12.\nThe decision table only shows 666.\nThe unspecified columns implicitly represent invalid combinations.\nFor example, an international subscription without data would not be possible.\nIn small decision tables, non-boolean conditions can be useful.\nHowever, with many non-boolean conditions, the amount of possible combinations in the decision table can be large.\nDue to this combinatorial explosion of possible variants, the decision table becomes very hard to work with.\nFor example, a decision table with three conditions, each having 444 possible values, results in 4⋅4⋅4=644 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 = 644⋅4⋅4=64 possible combinations.\nIn such cases, other strategies like pair-wise combinatorial testing offer better scalability. \nThe testing techniques for decision tables with only boolean conditions can also be generalized to tables with non-boolean conditions.\nFor the MC/DC criteria (discussed in the structural testing chapter), this requires modifying one of its three properties: instead of making each condition true and false at least once in the test suite, each of its possible values should appear at least once in the test suite.\nFinally, these are some general guidelines to keep in mind when designing decision tables:\n\nKeep conditions independent. The order of the conditions should not matter, otherwise a state machine might be more fitting.\nUse DC values when possible. This decreases the amount of variants, making the decision table easier to read and easier to understand.\nVariants with DC values should not overlap. If they do, they should at least have the same action.\nAdd a default column. This provides an action for the variants that are not in the decision table, allowing the decision table to not include all possible variants.\nConsider non-boolean conditions if conditions are mutually exclusive. Mutually exclusive means that the conditions can never be true at the same time. These conditions then probably encode a single non-boolean condition.\nIf most conditions are non-boolean, consider using a different combinatorial testing technique instead. One example would be pair-wise testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState Machines\nA state machine is a model that describes the software system by describing its states.\nA system often has multiple states and various transitions between these states.\nThe state machine model uses these states and transitions to illustrate the system's behaviour.\nThe main focus of a state machine is, as the name suggests, the states of a system.\nSo, it is useful to think about what a state actually is.\nThe states in a state machine model describe where a program is in its execution. \nTransitions are actions that take the system from one state to another.\nWe can use as many states as we need to describe the system's behaviour well.\nBesides states and transitions, a state machine has an initial state and events.\nThe initial state is the state that the system starts in.\nFrom that state the system can transition to other states.\nEach transition is paired with an event.\nThis event is usually one or two words that describe what has to happen to make the transition.\nThere are some agreements on how to make the models.\nThe notation we use is the Unified Modelling Language, UML.\nFor the state diagrams that means we use the following symbols:\n\nState: \nTransition: \nEvent: \nInitial state: \n\nFor the following examples we model a (part of a) phone.\nWe start simply with a state machine that models the phone's ability to be locked or unlocked.\nA phone that can be either locked or unlocked has two states: locked and unlocked.\nBefore there were face recognition and fingerprint sensors, you had to enter a password to unlock the phone.\nA correct password unlocks the phone and if an incorrect password is given, the phone stays locked.\nFinally, an unlocked phone can be locked again by pushing the lock button.\nWe can use these events in the state machine.\n\nIn the diagram the initial state is LOCKED, because usually when someone starts using their phone, it is locked.\nThis should be represented in the initial state of the state machine.\nSometimes an event can lead to multiple states, depending on a certain condition.\nTo model this in the state machines, we use conditional transitions.\nThese transitions are only performed if the event happens and if the condition is true.\nThe conditions often depend on a certain value being used in the state machine.\nTo modify these values when a transition is taken in the state machine, we use actions.\nActions are associated with a transition and are performed when the system uses that transition to go into another state.\nThe notation for conditions and actions is as follows:\n\nConditional transition: \nAction: \n\nWhen a user types the wrong password four times in a row, the phone becomes blocked.\nWe use n in the model to represent the number of failed attempts.\nLet us look at the conditional transitions that we need to model this behaviour.\n\nWhen n (the number of failed unlock attempts) is smaller than 3, the phone stays in LOCKED state.\nHowever, when n is equal to 3, the phone goes to BLOCKED.\nHere we have an event, wrong password, that can lead to different states based on the condition.\nIn the previous state machine, n never changes.\nThis means that the phone will never go to its BLOCKED state, as that requires n to be equal to 3.\nWe can add actions to the state machine to make n change correctly.\n\nThese added actions are to set n to n+1 when an incorrect password is given and to 0 when a correct password is given.\nThis way the state machine will be in the BLOCKED state when a wrong password is given four times in a row.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting state-machines\nLike with the decision tables, we want to use the state machine model to derive tests for the software system.\nFirst of all, we look at what might be implemented incorrectly.\nAn obvious potential error is a transition to the wrong state.\nThis will cause the system to act incorrectly, so we want the tests to catch such errors.\nAdditionally, the conditions in conditional transitions and the actions in transition can be wrong.\nFinally, the behaviour of a state should stay the same at all times.\nThis means that moving from and to a state should not change the behaviour of that state.\nFor state machines, we have a couple of test coverages.\nIn this chapter we go over three main ways to define test coverage:\n\nState coverage: each state has to be reached at least once\nTransition coverage: each transition has to be exercised at least once\nPaths: not exactly a way of describing test coverage, but we use paths to derive test cases\n\nTo achieve the state coverage, we generally bring the system into a state through transitions and then assert that the system is in that state.\nTo test a single transition (for transition coverage), more steps are needed:\n\nBring the system into the state that the transition being tested goes out of;\nAssert that the system is in that state;\nTrigger the transition event;\nIf there is an action, check if this action has happened;\nAssert that the system is in the new state that the transition points to.\n\nTo achieve full state coverage, we need to arrive in each state once.\nFor the phone example we have three states so we can make three tests.\n\nCheck that the system is LOCKED when it is started;\nGive the correct password and check that the system is UNLOCKED;\nGive an incorrect password four times and check that the system is BLOCKED.\n\nWith these three tests we achieve full state coverage, as the system is in each state at a certain point.\nWith the tests above, we have covered most of the transitions as well.\nThe only untested transition is the lock button from UNLOCKED to LOCKED.\nTo test this transition, we make the system UNLOCKED by giving the correct password.\nThen we trigger the lock button and assert that the system is LOCKED.\nPaths and Transition trees\nBesides the individual transitions, we can also test the combinations of transitions.\nThese combinations of transitions are called paths.\nA logical thought might be: let's test all the paths in the state machine.\nWhile this looks like a good objective, the number of paths will probably be too high.\nTake a state machine that has a loop, i.e., a transition from state X to Y and a transition from state Y to X.\nWhen creating paths, we can keep going back and forth between these two states.\nThis leads to an infinite number of paths.\nObviously, we cannot test all the paths, so we need to take a different approach.\nThe idea is that when using paths to derive test cases, we want each loop to be executed once.\nThis way we have a finite number of paths to be tested.\nWe derive these tests by using a transition tree, which spans the graph of the state machine.\nSuch a transition tree is created as follows:\n\nThe root node is the initial state of the state machine;\nFor each of the nodes at the lowest level of the transition tree:\nIf the state that the node corresponds to has not been covered before:\nFor each of the outgoing transitions of this node's state:\n Add a child node that has the name of the state the transition points to. If this state is already in the tree, add or increment a number after the state's name to keep the node unique.\nIf any nodes were added: \nRepeat from step 2. \n\n\n\nThis is demonstrated in the example below.\nTo make the transition tree more interesting, we modify the phone's state machine to have an OFF state instead of a BLOCKED state.\nSee the state machine below:\n\nThe root node of the transition tree is the initial state of the state machine.\nWe append a number to make it easier to distinguish this node from other nodes of the same state.\n\nFor each outgoing transition from the OFF state we add a child node to OFF_0.\n\nOne node was added, so we continue by adding children to that node.\n\nThe only state we have not seen yet is UNLOCKED in the UNLOCKED_0 node.\nTherefore, this is the only node we should add children to.\n\nNow all the states of the nodes in the lowest layer have been visited so the transition tree is done.\nFrom a complete transition tree, we can derive tests.\nEach leaf node in the transition tree represents one path to test.\nThis path is shown by going from the root node to this leaf node.\nIn the tests, we assume that we are starting in the correct state.\nThen, we trigger the next event that is needed for the given path and assume that we are in the next correct state.\nThese events that we need to trigger can be found in the state machine.\nThis process continues until the whole path has been followed.\nIn the transition tree of the previous example there are four leaf nodes: OFF_1, OFF_2, LOCKED_1, LOCKED_2.\nWe want a test for each of these leaf nodes, that follows the path leading to that node.\nFor OFF_1 the test should 'move' the system from OFF to LOCKED and back to OFF.\nLooking at the state machine this gives the events home, long lock button.\nIn the test we check that the system is OFF, then we trigger home and check that the system is LOCKED, then we trigger long lock button and assert that the system is OFF.\nThe tests for the other three paths can be derived in a similar fashion.\nUsing the transition tree, each loop that is in the state machine is executed once and while testing most of the important paths in the state machine, the number of tests is manageable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSneak paths and transition tables\nIn the previous section, we discussed transition trees and how to use them to derive tests.\nThese tests check if the system behaves correctly when following different paths in the state machine.\nWith this way of testing, we check if the existing transitions in a state machine behave correctly.\nHowever, we do not check whether there are any more transitions; transitions that should not be there.\nWe call these paths, \"sneak paths\".\nA sneak path is a path in the state machine that should not exist.\nSo, for example, we have state X and Y and the system should not be able to transition directly from X to Y.\nIf the system can in some way transition directly from X to Y, we have a sneak path.\nWe need to test to see if such sneak paths exist in the system.\nTo achieve this, we make use of transition tables.\nA transition table is a table containing each transition that is in the state machine.\nThe transition is given by the state it is going out of, the event that triggers the transition, and the state the transition goes to.\nWe construct a transition table as follows:\n\nList all the state machine's states along the rows;\nList all events along the columns;\nFor each transition in the state machine note its destination state in the correct cell of the transition table.\n\nWe take a look at the same state machine for which we created a transition table:\n\nTo make the transition table we list all the states and events in the table:\n\n  \n    STATES\n    Events\n  \n  \n    \n    home\n    wrong password\n    correct password\n    lock button\n    long lock button\n  \n  \n    OFF\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    LOCKED\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    UNLOCKED\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nThen we fill the table with the states that the transitions in the state machine point to:\n\n  \n    STATES\n    Events\n  \n  \n    \n    home\n    wrong password\n    correct password\n    lock button\n    long lock button\n  \n  \n    OFF\n    LOCKED\n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    LOCKED\n    \n    LOCKED\n    UNLOCKED\n    \n    OFF\n  \n  \n    UNLOCKED\n    \n    \n    \n    LOCKED\n    OFF\n  \n\n\nWe can see that there is, for example, a transition from UNLOCKED to LOCKED when the event lock button is triggered.\nWhen we have the transition table, we have to decide the intended behaviour for the cells that are empty.\nThe default is to ignore the event and stay in the same state.\nIn some cases, one might want the system to throw an exception.\nThese decisions depend on the project and the customer's needs.\nAs discussed earlier, we can use the transition table to derive tests for sneak paths.\nUsually, we want the system to remain in its current state when we trigger an event that has an empty cell in the transition table.\nTo test for all possible sneak paths, we create a test case for each empty cell in the transition table.\nFirst of all, the test will bring the system to the state corresponding to the empty cell's row (you can use the transition tree to find a suitable path). Then the test triggers the event that corresponds to the empty cell's column. Finally, the test asserts that the system is in the same state as before triggering the event.\nThe number of 'sneak path tests' is equal to the number of empty cells in the transition table.\nWith these tests we can verify both existing and non-existing paths.\nTogether these techniques produce a good testing suite from a state machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper states and regions\nUp till now, we have looked at simple and small state machines.\nWhen the modelled system becomes large and complex, it is typical for the state machine to develop in the same way.\nAt some point the state machine will consist of so many states and transitions, that it becomes unclear and impractical to manage.\nTo resolve this issue and make a state machine more scalable we use super states and regions.\nSuper state: A super state is a state that consists of a state machine.\nBasically, we wrap a state machine in a super-state which is used as a state in another state machine.\nThe notation of the super-state is as follows:\n\nAs a super state is, in essence, a state machine that can be used as a state, we know what should be inside the super state.\nThe super state generally consists of multiple states and transitions, and it always has to have an initial state.\nAny transition going into the super state goes to the initial state of the super state.\nA transition going out of the super state means that if the event on this transition is triggered in any of the super state's states, the system transitions into the state this transition points to.\nWe can choose to show the super state fully or we can collapse it.\nA collapsed super state is just a normal state in the state machine.\nThis state has the super state's name and the same incoming and outgoing transitions as the super state.\nWith the super states and the collapsing of super states we can modularise and combine state machines.\nThis allows us to shift the state machine's focus to different parts of the system's behaviour.\nWe can use a super state even in the small example of a phone's state machine.\nThe two states LOCKED and UNLOCKED both represent the system in some sort of ON state.\nWe can use this to create a super state called ON.\n\nNow we can also simplify the state machine by collapsing the super state:\n\nRegions:\nSo far, we have had super states that contain one state machine.\nHere, the system is in only one state of the super state at once.\nIn some cases, it may be useful to allow the system to be in multiple states at once.\nThis is achieved with regions.\nA super state can be split into multiple regions.\nThese are orthogonal regions, meaning that the state machines in the regions are independent of each other; they do not influence the state machines in other regions.\nEach region contains one state machine.\nWhen the system enters the super state, it enters all the initial states of the regions.\nThis means that the system is in multiple states at once.\nThe notation of regions is: \nExpanding regions is possible, but is highly impractical and usually not wanted, because expanding a region requires the creation of a state for each combination of states in the different regions.\nThis causes the number of states and transitions to explode quickly.\nFor this reason, we will not cover how to expand regions.\nIn general, it is best to use small state machines and to link these together using super states and regions.\nSo far when the phone was ON, we modelled the LOCKED and UNLOCKED state.\nWhen the phone is on, it drains the battery.\nThe system keeps track of the level of the battery.\nLet's assume that our phone has two battery levels: low and normal.\nThe draining of the battery and the transitions between the states of the battery run in parallel to the phone being locked or unlocked.\nWith parallel behaviour like this, we can use the regions in the state machine model, which looks like the following, with the new battery states and the regions:\n\nYou see that we assume that the battery starts in the normal level state.\nTherefore, when the system transitions to the ON state, it will be in both LOCKED and NORMAL BATTERY states at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementing state-based testing in practice\nYou have now learnt a lot about state machines as a model.\nOne thing we have not looked at yet is how these state machines are represented in the actual code.\nStates are very common in programming.\nMost classes in Object-Oriented-Programming correspond to their own small state machine.\nIn these classes, we distinguish two types of methods: inspection and trigger methods.\nAn inspection method only provides information about an object's state.\nThis information consists of the values or fields of an object.\nThe inspection methods only provide information. They do not change the state (or values) of an object.\nTrigger methods bring the class into a new state.\nThis can be done by changing some of the class's values.\nThese trigger methods correspond to the events on the transitions in the state machine.\nIn a test, we want to bring the class to different states and assert that after each transition, the class is in the expected state.\nIn other words, a test scenario is basically a series of calls on the class's trigger methods.\nBetween these calls, we can call the inspection methods to check the state.\nWhen a state machine corresponds to a single class, we can easily use the methods described above to test the state machine.\nHowever, sometimes the state machine spans over multiple classes.\nIn that case, you might not be able to identify the inspection and trigger methods easily.\nIn this scenario, the state machines can even correspond to end-to-end / system testing.\nHere, the flow of the entire system is under test, from input to output.\nThe system under test does not always provide a programming interface (API) to inspect the state or trigger the event for the transitions.\nA common example of such a system is a web application.\nIn the end, the web application works through a browser.\nTo access the state or to trigger the transitions you would then need to use a dedicated tool, like webdriver.\nUsing such a dedicated tool directly is not ideal, as you would have to specify each individual click on the web page to trigger events.\nWhat we need is an abstraction layer on top of the system being tested.\nThis abstraction can be a Java class, with the methods that we need to be able to test the system as its state machine.\nIn this way, the abstraction layer will contain the inspection method to check the state and the trigger methods to perform the transitions.\nWith this small abstraction layer, we can formulate the tests clearly.\nTriggering a transition is a single method call and checking the state also requires only one method call.\nAnother example of a real-world model\nSlack shared their internal flow chart that decides whether to send a notification of a message:\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nThe ColdHot air conditioning system has the following requirements:\n\nWhen the user turns it on, the machine is in an idle state. This is the initial state.\nIf it is too hot, then, the cooling process starts. It goes back to idle when the defined temperature is reached.\nIf it is too cold, then, the heating process starts. It goes back to idle when the defined temperature is reached.\nIf the user turns it off, the machine is off. If the user turns it on again, the machine is back to idle.\n\nDraw a minimal state machine to represent these requirements.\nExercise 2.\nDerive the transition tree from the state machine of the assignment above.\nExercise 3.\nDerive the transition table of the ColdHot state machine.\nHow many sneaky paths can be tested based on this transition table?\nExercise 4.\n(Exercise removed)\nExercise 5.\nWith the transition tree you devised in the previous exercise and the state machine in that exercise, what is the transition coverage of a test that includes the following events: [order placed, order received, order fulfilled, order delivered]?\nExercise 6.\nDevise the decision table of the state machine that was given in the exercise above.\nIgnore the initial transition Order placed.\nExercise 7.\nHow many sneak paths are there in the state machine we used in the previous exercises?\nAgain, ignore the initial Order placed transition.\nExercise 8.\nConsider the following decision table:\n\n  CriteriaOptions\n  C1: Employed for 1 yearTFFTTT\n  C2: Achieved last year's goalTdcdcFTF\n  C3: Positive evaluation from peersTFTFFT\n  10%0%5%2%6%3%\n\n\nWhich decisions do we have to test for full MC/DC?\nUse as few decisions as possible.\nExercise 9.\nSee the following generic state machine.\n\nDraw the transition tree of this state machine.\nExercise 10.\nThe advertisement (ad) feature is an important source of income for the company. Because of that, the life cycle of an ad needs to be better modelled.\nOur product team defined the following rules:\n\nThe life cycle of an ad starts with an 'empty' ad being created.\nThe company provides information about the ad. More specifically, the company defines an image, a description, and how many times it should appear. When all this information is set, the ad then needs to wait for approval.\nAn administrator checks the content of the ad. If it follows all the rules, the ad then waits for payment. If the ad contains anything illegal, it then goes back to the beginning of the process.\nAs soon as the company makes the payment, the ad becomes available to users.\nWhen the target number of visualisations is reached, the ad is considered done. At this time, the company might consider running the campaign again, which moves the ad to wait for payment again. The company might also decide to end the campaign at that moment, which puts the ad in a final state.  \nWhile appearing for the users, if more than 10% of the users complain about the ad, the ad is then marked as blocked. The company then gets contacted. After understanding the case, the ad either starts to appear again, or is labelled as inappropriate. An inappropriate ad will never be shown again.\n\nDevise a state diagram that describes the life cycle of an ad.\nExercise 11.\nA microwave oven has the following requirements:\n\nIts initial state is OFF.\nWhen the user turns it on, the machine goes to an ON state.\nIf the user selects warm meal, then, the WARMING process starts. It goes back to ON when the defined time is reached. A user may cancel it at any time, taking the microwave back to the ON state.\nIf the user selects defrost meal, then, the DEFROSTING process starts. It goes back to ON when the defined time is reached. A user may cancel it at any time, taking the microwave back to the ON state.\nThe user can turn off the microwave (after which it is OFF), but only if the microwave is not warming up or defrosting food.\n\nDraw a minimal state machine to represent the requirements. For this question do not make use of super (OR) states.\nAlso, remember that, if a transition is not specified in the requirements, it simply does not exist, and thus, should not be represented in the state machine.\nExercise 12.\nDevise a state transition tree for the microwave state machine.\nExercise 13.\nAgain, consider the state machine requirements for the microwave.\nThere appears to be some redundancy in the defrosting and warming up functionality, which potentially can be described using super states (also called OR-states).\nWhich effect does this have on the total number of states and transitions for the resulting diagram with a super state?\n\nThere will be one extra state, and two fewer transitions.\nThere will be one state less, and the same number of transitions.\nThe total number of states will remain the same, and there will be two fewer transitions.\nThis has no effect on the total number of states and transitions.\n\nExercise 14.\nSee the requirement below:\nStefan works for Foodgram, a piece of software that enables users to send pictures of the dishes they prepare themselves. Foodgram's upload system has specific rules:\n\n* The software should only accept images in JPG format.\n* The software should not accept images that are bigger than 20MB.\n* The software accepts images in both high and low resolution.\n\nAs soon as a user uploads a photo, the aforementioned rules are applied.\nThe software then either says *\"Congratulations! Your picture was uploaded successfully\"*, or *\"Ooops, something went wrong!\"*\" (without any specific details about why it happened).\nCreate a decision table that takes the three conditions and their respective outcomes into account.\nNote: conditions should be modelled as Boolean decisions.\nExercise 15\nTwitter is a software system that enables users to share short messages with their friends.\nTwitter's revenue model is ultimately based on advertisements (ads).\nTwitter's system needs to decide when to show ads to its users, and which ones. For a given user a given ad can be highly-relevant, and the system seeks to serve the most relevant ads as often as possible without scaring users away.\nTo that end, assume that the system employs the following rules to decide whether a user U gets served an ad A at the moment user U opens their Twitter app:\n\nIf the user U has not been active during the past two weeks, she will not get to see ad A;\nIf the user U has already been served an ad during her last hour of activity, she will not get to see ad A;\nFurthermore, if the user U has over 1000 followers (an influencer), she will only get to see ad A if A is labelled as highly-relevant for U. Otherwise, user U will see A even if it is not highly-relevant.\n\nWe can model this procedure in a decision table, in various ways.\nThe complete table would have four conditions and 16 variants. We will try to create a more compact decision table. Note: We will use Boolean conditions only.\nOne way is to focus on the positive cases only, i.e., specify only the variants in which ad A is being served to user U. If you do not use 'DC' (don't care) values, how will the decision table look?\nReferences\n\nChapter 4 of the Foundations of software testing: ISTQB certification.

Just to remember: oracles inform us\nwhether the software behaved correctly.\nSo far, we only used \"value comparison\" as oracle. Given an input that\nwe devised, we knew what output to expect. For example, in a program that\nreturns the square root of a number, given n=4, the value we expect as output\nis 2.\nInstead of focusing on a specific instances, like we did so far, property checks, like the ones we are going to see in the remaining of this chapter, are more general rules (properties) that we assert on our code. For example, a program that, given nnn, returns n2n^2n​2​​, has a property that it should never return a negative number.\nAssertions also serve as an extra safety measure.\nIf it is crucial that a system runs correctly, we can use the asserts to add some additional testing during the system's execution.\nNote that assertions do not replace unit tests.\nAssertions are often of a more general nature.\nWe still need the specific cases in the unit tests. A combination of\nboth is what we desire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre- and Post-conditions\nWe briefly mentioned pre- and post-condition in an example.\nLet us formalise the idea and see how to create good pre- and post-conditions and their influence on the code that we are writing.\nTony Hoare pioneered reasoning about programs with assertions, proposing what is now called Hoare Triples.\nA Hoare Triple consists of a set of pre-conditions {P}\\{ P \\}{P}, a program AAA and a set of post-conditions {Q}\\{ Q \\}{Q}\nWe can express the Hoare Triple as follows: {P} A {Q}\\{ P \\}\\ A\\ \\{ Q \\}{P} A {Q}.\nThis can be read as: if we know that PPP holds, and we execute AAA, then, we end up in a state where QQQ holds.\nIf there are no pre-conditions, i.e., no assumptions needed for the execution of AAA, we can simply set PPP to true.\nIn a Hoare Triple, the AAA can be a single statement or a whole program.\nWe will take AAA to be a method.\nAs such, PPP and QQQ are the pre- and post-condition of the method AAA respectively.\nNow we can write the Hoare Triple as: {pre−conditions} method {post−conditions}\\{ \\mathit{pre-conditions} \\}\\ \\mathit{method}\\ \\{ \\mathit{post-conditions} \\}{pre−conditions} method {post−conditions}.\nPre-conditions\nWhen writing a method, each condition that needs to hold for the method to successfully execute can be a pre-condition.\nThese pre-conditions can be turned into assertions.\nSuppose a class that keeps track of one's favourite books.\nLet us define some pre-conditions for the merge method.\nThe method adds the given books to the list of favourite books and then sends some notification to, e.g., a phone.\npublic class FavoriteBooks {\n  List favorites;\n\n  // ...\n\n  public void merge(List books) {\n    favorites.addAll(books);\n    pushNotification.booksAdded(books);\n  }\n}\n\nWhen creating pre-conditions, testers have to think about what needs to hold to let the method execute.\nWe can focus on the parameter books first.\nIt cannot be null, because then the addAll method will throw a NullPointerException.\nIt should also not be empty, because then no books will be added to the favourites.\nFinally, there has to be at least a single book that is not yet in the favourites list.\nNow let us take a look at favorites.\nThis also cannot be null because then it is not possible to call addAll on favourites.\nThis gives us 4 pre-conditions and, thus, 4 assertions in the method:\npublic class FavoriteBooks {\n  // ...\n\n  public void merge(List books) {\n    assert books != null : \"The list of books is null\";\n    assert favorites != null : \"The favorites list is null\";\n    assert !books.isEmpty() : \"There are no books in the given list\";\n    assert !favorites.containsAll(books) : \"All books in the given list are already in favorites\";\n\n    favorites.addAll(books);\n    pushNotification.booksAdded(books);\n  }\n}\n\nThe number of assumptions made before a method can be executed (and, with that, the number of pre-conditions) is a design choice.\nOne might want to weaken the pre-conditions, so that the method accepts/is able to handle more situations.\nTo that aim, we can remove a pre-condition as the method itself can handle the situation where the pre-condition would be false.\nThis makes the method more generally applicable, but is also increases its complexity.\nThe method always has to check some extra things to handle the cases that could had been pre-conditions.\nFinding the balance between the number of pre-conditions and complexity of the method is part of designing the system.\nWe can remove some of the pre-conditions of the merge method by adding some if-statements to the method.\nFirst, we can try to remove the !books.isEmpty() assertions.\nThis means that the method merge has to handle empty books lists itself.\npublic class FavoriteBooks {\n  // ...\n\n  public void merge(List books) {\n    assert books != null : \"The list of books is null\";\n    assert favorites != null : \"The favorites list is null\";\n    assert !favorites.containsAll(books) : \"All books in the given list are already in favorites\";\n\n    if (!books.isEmpty()) {\n      favorites.addAll(books);\n      pushNotification.booksAdded(books);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nBy generalising the merge method, we have removed one of the pre-conditions.\nWe can even remove the !favorites.containsAll(books) assertion by adding some more functionality to the method.\npublic class FavoriteBooks {\n  // ...\n\n  public void merge(List books) {\n    assert books != null : \"The list of books is null\";\n    assert favorites != null : \"The favorites list is null\";\n\n    List newBooks = books.removeAll(favorites);\n\n    if (!newBooks.isEmpty()) {\n      favorites.addAll(newBooks);\n      pushNotification.booksAdded(newBooks);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNote that, although we increased the complexity of method by removing some of its pre-conditions and dealing with these cases in the implementation, the method is now also easier to be called by clients. After all, the method has less pre-conditions to be considered.\nPost-conditions\nThe pre-conditions of a method hold when the method is called. At the end of the method, its post-conditions should hold.\nIn other words, the post-conditions formalise the effects that a method guarantees to have when it is done with its execution.\nThe merge method of the previous examples does two things.\nFirst, it adds the new books to the favorites list.\nLet us turn this into a Boolean expression, so we can formulate this as a post-condition.\npublic class FavoriteBooks {\n  // ...\n\n  public void merge(List books) {\n    assert books != null : \"The list of books is null\";\n    assert favorites != null : \"The favorites list is null\";\n\n    List newBooks = books.removeAll(favorites);\n\n    if (!newBooks.isEmpty()) {\n      favorites.addAll(newBooks);\n      pushNotification.booksAdded(newBooks);\n    }\n\n    assert favorites.containsAll(books) : \"Not all books were added to favorites\";\n  }\n}\n\nThe other effect of the method is the notification that is sent.\nUnfortunately, we cannot easily formalise it as a post-condition.\nIn a test suite, we would probably mock the pushNotification and then use Mockito.verify to verify that booksAdded was called.\nIt is important to realise that these post-conditions only have to hold if the pre-conditions held when the method was called. In other words, if the method's pre-conditions were not fully satisfied, the method might not guarantee its post-conditions.\nYou also saw in the example that we could not really write assertions for\nsome of post-conditions of the method. \nPost-conditions (and pre-conditions for that matter) might not cover all the possible effects; however,\nhopefully they do cover a relevant subset of the possible behaviour.\nFor complex methods, the post-conditions also become more complex.\nThat is actually another reason for keeping the method simple.\nSuppose a method with multiple return points. That might require the developer to define different post-conditions for each of its different outcomes:\nif (A) {\n  // ...\n  if (B) {\n    // ...\n    assert PC1;\n    return ...;\n  } else {\n    // ...\n    assert PC2;\n    return ...;\n  }\n}\n// ...\nassert PC3;\nreturn ...;\n\nThe method above has three conditions and three different return statements.\nThis also gives us three post-conditions.\nIn the example, if A and B are true, post-condition 1 should hold.\nIf A is true but B is false, post-condition 2 should hold.\nFinally, if A is false, post-condition 3 should hold.\nThe placing of these post-conditions now becomes quite important, so the whole method is becoming rather complex with the post-conditions.\nRefactoring the method so that it has just a single return statement\nwith a general post-condition is advisable.\nOtherwise, the post-condition essentially becomes a disjunction of propositions.\nEach return statement forms a possible post-condition (proposition) and the method guarantees that one of these post-conditions is met.\nHow do weak pre-conditions affect the post-conditions?\nBased on what we saw about pre- and post-conditions, we can come up with a few\nrules:\n\nThe weaker the pre-conditions, the more situations a method\nis able to handle, and the less thinking the client needs to do.\nHowever, with weak pre-conditions, the method will always have to do\nthe checking.\n\nThe post-conditions are only guaranteed if the pre-conditions held; if not,\nthe outcome can be anything. With weak pre-conditions the method might have\nto handle different situations, leading to multiple post-conditions guarded\nby conditions over the inputs or the program state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvariants\nWe have seen that pre-conditions should hold before a method's execution and post-conditions should hold after a method's execution.\nNow we move to conditions that always have to hold, before and after a method's execution.\nThese conditions are called invariants.\nAn invariant is thus a condition that holds throughout the entire lifetime of a system, an object, or a data structure.\nIn terms of implementation, a simple way of using invariants is by creating a \"checker\" method.\nThis method will go through the data structure/object/system and will assert whether the invariants hold.\nIf an invariant does not hold, it will then throw an AssertionError.\nFor simpler invariants, it is common to see a Boolean method that checks the invariants of the structure/object/system.\nSuppose we have a binary tree data structure.\nAn invariant for this data structure would be that when a parent points to a child, then the child should point to this parent.\nWe can make a method that checks if this representation is correct in the given binary tree.\npublic void checkRep(BinaryTree tree) {\n  BinaryTree left = tree.getLeft();\n  BinaryTree right = tree.getRight();\n\n  assert (left == null || left.getParent() == tree) &&\n      (right == null || right.getParent() == tree) :\n      \"A child does not point to the correct parent\";\n\n  if (left != null) {\n    checkRep(left);\n  }\n  if (right != null) {\n    checkRep(right);\n  }\n}\n\nIn checkRep(), we first check if the children nodes of the current node are pointing to this node as parent.\nThen, we continue by checking the child nodes the same way we checked the current node.\nClass invariants\nIn Object-Oriented Programming, these checks can also be applied at the class-level.\nThis gives us class invariants.\nA class invariant ensures that its conditions will be true throughout the entire lifetime of the object.\nThe first time a class invariant should be true is right after its construction (i.e., when the constructor method is done).\nThe class invariant should also hold after each public method invocation.\nMoreover, methods can assume that, when they start, the class invariant holds.\nA private method invoked by a public method can leave the object with the class invariant being false.\nHowever, the public method that invoked the private method should then fix this and end with the class invariant again being true.\nThis is all formalised by Bertrand Meyer as: \"The class variant indicates that a proposition P can be a class invariant if it holds after construction, and before and after any call to a public method assuming that the public methods are called with their pre-conditions being true.\"\nTo implement simple class invariant in Java, we can use the Boolean method that checks if the representation is okay.\nWe usually call this method invariant.\nWe then assert the return value of this method after the constructor, and before and after each public method.\nIn these public methods, the only pre-conditions and post-conditions that have to hold additionally are the ones that are not in the invariant.\nLet us return to the FavoriteBooks with the merge method.\nWe had a pre-condition saying that favorites != null.\nGiven that this should always be true, we can turn it into a class variant.\nAdditionally, we can add the condition that pushNotification != null.\npublic class FavoriteBooks {\n  List favorites;\n  Listener pushNotification;\n\n  public FavoriteBooks(...) {\n    favorites = ...;\n    pushNotification = ...;\n\n    // ...\n\n    assert invariant() : \"Invariant does not hold\";\n  }\n\n  protected boolean invariant() {\n    return favorites != null && pushNotification != null;\n  }\n\n  public void merge(List books) {\n    assert invariant() : \"Invariant does not hold\";\n\n    // Remaining pre-conditions\n    assert books != null : \"The list of books is null\";\n\n    List newBooks = books.removeAll(favorites);\n\n    if (!newBooks.isEmpty()) {\n      favorites.addAll(newBooks);\n      pushNotification.booksAdded(newBooks);\n    }\n\n    // Remaining post-conditions\n    assert favorites.containsAll(books) : \"Not all books were added to favorites\";\n\n    assert invariant() : \"Invariant does not hold\";\n  }\n\n}\n\nNote that the invariant method checks the two conditions.\nWe call invariant before and after merge and we only assert the pre- and post-conditions that are not covered in the invariant method.\nWe also assert the result of the invariant method at the end of the constructor.\nWhen handling more complicated invariants, we can split the invariant into more methods.\nThen we use these methods in the invariant method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign by Contracts\nSuppose a client system and a server system. The client makes use of the server's API. \nThe client and server are bound by a contract.\nThe server does its job as long as its methods are used properly by the client.\nThis relates strongly to the pre- and post-conditions that we discussed earlier.\nThe client has to use the server's methods in a way that their pre-conditions hold.\nThe server then guarantees that the post-conditions will hold after the method call, i.e., makes sure the method delivers what it promises.\nNote how the pre- and post-conditions of the server forms a contract\nbetween the server and the client.\nDesigning a system following such contracts is called what\nwe call Design by Contracts.\nIn such design, contracts are represented by interfaces.\nThese interfaces are used by the client and implemented by the server.\nThe following UML diagram illustrates it:\n\nSubcontracting\nImagine now an interface. This interface has its own pre- and post-conditions.\nNow, what happens to these conditions when we create another implementation of this interface (i.e., a class that implements the interface, or a class that extends some base class)?\nIn the UML diagram above, we see that the implementation can have different pre-, post-conditions, and invariants than its base interface.\nIn terms of pre-conditions, the new implementation must be able to work with the pre-conditions that were specified in the interface.\nAfter all, the interface is the only thing the client sees of the system.\nThe implementation cannot add any pre-conditions to the server's pre-conditions.\nIn terms of strength, we now know that P′P'P​′​​ has to be weaker than (or as weak as) PPP.\nThe post-condition works the other way around.\nThe implementation must do at least the same work as the interface, but is allowed to do a bit more.\nTherefore, Q′Q'Q​′​​ should be stronger than (or as strong as) QQQ.\nFinally, the interface guarantees that the invariant always holds.\nThen, the implementation should also guarantee that at least the interface's invariant holds.\nSo, I′I'I​′​​ should be stronger than (or as strong as) III.\nIn short, using the notation of the UML diagram:\n\nP′P'P​′​​ weaker than PPP\nQ′Q'Q​′​​ stronger than QQQ\nI′I'I​′​​ stronger than III\n\nThe subcontract (the implementation) requires no more and ensures no less than the actual contract (the interface).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiskov Substitution Principle\nThe subcontracting follows the general notion of behavioural subtyping, proposed by Barbara Liskov.\nThe behavioural subtyping states that if we have a class T and this class has some sub-classes,\nthe clients or users of class T should be able to choose any of T's sub-classes.\nThis notion of behavioural subtyping is now known as the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP).\nIn other words, the LSP states that if you use a class, you should be able to replace this class by one of its subclasses.\nThe sub-contracting we discussed earlier is just a formalisation of this principle.\nProper class hierarchies follow the Liskov Substitution Principle.\nKeep the LSP in mind when designing and implementing a software system.\nHow can we test that our classes follow the LSP?\nTo test the LSP, we have to make some test cases for the public methods of the super class and execute these tests with all its subclasses.\nWe could just create the same tests to each of the subclasses' test suites.\nHowever, this leads to a lot of code duplication in the test code, which we would like to avoid.\nIn Java, the List interface is implemented by various sub-classes, such as ArrayList and LinkedList.\nCreating the tests for each of the sub-classes separately will result in the following structure.\n\nThe ArrayList and LinkedList will behave the same for the methods defined in List.\nTherefore, there will be duplicate tests for these methods.\nTo avoid this code duplication we can create a test suite just for the super class.\nThis test suite tests just the public methods of the super class.\nThe tests in this test suite should then be executed for each \nof the sub-classes of the super class.\nThis can be done by making the test classes extend the \"super test class\".\nThe \"sub test class\" will have all the common tests defined in the \"super test class\" and its own specific tests.\nThis is how the test suite looks like:\n\nHere, the ArrayListTest and LinkedListTest extend the ListTest.\nList is an interface, so the ListTest should be abstract.\nWe cannot instantiate a List itself, so we should not be able to execute the ListTest without a test class corresponding to one of List's subclasses.\nListTest contains all the common tests of ArrayListTest and LinkedListTest.\nArrayListTest and LinkedListTest can contain their specific tests.\nIn the example, one can see that the hierarchy of the test classes is similar to the hierarchy of the classes they test.\nTherefore, we say that we use a parallel class hierarchy in our test classes.\nImplementation-wise,\nhow do we make sure that the \"super test class\" executes its tests in the correct subclass?\nThis depends on the test class that is executed and the subclass it is testing.\nIf we have class T, with subclasses A and B, then when executing tests for A we need the test class of T to use an instance of A; when executing tests for B, we need the test class of T to use an instance of B.\nOne way to achieve this behaviour is by using the Factory Method design pattern,\nwhich works as follows:\nIn the test class for the interface level (the \"super test class\"), we define an abstract method that returns an instance with the interface type.\nBy making the method abstract, we force the test classes of the concrete implementations to override it.\nWe return the instance of the specific subclass in the overridden method.\nThis instance is then used to execute the tests.\nWe want to use the Factory Method design pattern in our tests for the List.\nWe start by the interface level test class.\nHere, we define the abstract method that gives us a List.\npublic abstract class ListTest {\n\n  private List list;\n\n  protected abstract List createList();\n\n  @BeforeEach\n  public void setUp() {\n    list = createList();\n  }\n\n  // Common List tests using list\n}\n\nThen, for this example, we create a class to test the ArrayList.\nWe have to override the createList method and we can define any tests specific for the ArrayList.\npublic class ArrayListTest extends ListTest {\n\n  @Override\n  protected List createList() {\n    return new ArrayList();\n  }\n\n  // Tests specific for the ArrayList\n}\n\nNow, the ArrayListTest inherits all the ListTest's tests, so these will be executed when we execute the ArrayListTest test suite.\nBecause the createList() method returns an ArrayList, the common test classes will use an ArrayList.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nSee the code below:\npublic Square squareAt(int x, int y) {\n  assert x >= 0;\n  assert x = 0;\n  assert y \nWhat assertion(s), if any, can be turned into a class invariant?\nExercise 2.\nConsider the piece of code in the previous example.\nSuppose we remove the last assertion (line 10), which states that the result can never be null.\nAre the existing pre-conditions of the squareAt method enough to ensure the property in the original line 10?\nWhat can we add to the class (other than the just removed post-condition) to guarantee this property?\nExercise 3.\nYour colleague works on a drawing application.\nHe has created a Rectangle class.\nFor rectangles, the width and height can be different from each other, but can't be negative numbers.\nYour colleague also defines the Square class.\nSquares are a special type of rectangle: the width and height should be equal and also can't be negative.\nYour colleague decides to implement this by making Square inherit from Rectangle.\nThe code for the two classes is the following.\nclass Rectangle {\n  protected int width;\n  protected int height;\n\n  protected boolean invariant() { return width > 0 && height > 0; }\n\n  public Rectangle(int width, int height) {\n    assert width > 0;\n    assert height > 0;\n    this.width = width;\n    this.height = height;\n    assert invariant()\n  }\n\n  public int area() {\n    assert invariant();\n    int a = width * height;\n    assert a > 0;\n    return a;\n  }\n\n  public void resetSize(int width, int height) {\n    assert width > 0;\n    assert height > 0;\n    this.width = width;\n    this.height = height;\n    assert invariant();\n  }\n}\n\nclass Square extends Rectangle {\n  public Square(int x) {\n    assert x > 0;\n    super(x, x);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void resetSize(int width, int height) {\n    assert width == height;\n    assert width > 0;\n    super.resetSize(width, height);\n  }\n}\n\nInspired by Bertrand Meyer's design by contracts, he also use asserts to make sure contracts are followed. He explicitly defines pre-conditions and post-conditions in various methods of the base Rectangle class and the derived Square class.\nA second colleague comes in and expresses concerns about the design.\nHow can you use the assertions provided to discuss the correctness of this design?\nIs the second colleagues concern justified?\nWhat principle is violated, if any?\nExplain with the assertions shown in the code.\nExercise 4.\nYou run your application with assertion checking enabled. \nUnfortunately, it reports an assertion failure signalling a class invariant violation in one of the libraries your application makes use of.\nAssume that the contract of the library in question is correct, and that all relevant pre-conditions are encoded in assertions as well.\nCan you fix this problem? \nIf so, how? \nIf not, why?\nExercise 5.\nHTTP requests return a status code which can have several values.

If we find an input value that makes the assertion to fail, we can affirm that the property does not hold.\nThe first implementation of this idea was called QuickCheck and was originally developed for Haskell.\nNowadays, most languages have an implementation of quick check, including Java.\nThe Java implementation we are going to use is jqwik.\nJqwik has several features to better support property based tests. In this chapter, we only skim through some of them. We recommend readers to dive into jqwik's manual.\n\nGetting started with property-based tests\nHow does it work?\n\nFirst, we define properties.\nSimilar to defining test methods, we use an annotation on a method with an assertion to define a property: @Property.\nQuickCheck includes a number of generators for various types.\nFor example, Strings, Integers, Lists, Dates, etc.\n\nTo generate values, we add some parameters to the annotated method.\nThe arguments for these parameters will then be automatically generated by jqwik.\nNote that the existing generators are often not enough when we want to test one\nof our own classes; in these cases, we can create a custom generator which generates random values for this class.\n\njqwik handles the number of generated inputs. After all, generating random values for the test input is tricky:\nthe generator might create too much data to efficiently handle while testing.\n\nFinally, as soon as jqwik finds a value that breaks the property, it\nstarts the shrinking process.\nUsing random input values can result in very large inputs.\nFor example lists that are very long or strings with a lot of characters.\nThese inputs can be very hard to debug. Smaller inputs are preferable when it comes to testing.\nWhen an input makes a property fail, jqwik tries to find a shrunken version of this input that still makes the property fail.\nThat way it gets the smallest part of a larger input that actually causes the problem.\n\n\nAs an example:\na property of Strings is that if we add two strings together, the length of the result should be the same as the sum of the lengths of the two strings summed.\nWe can use property-based testing and jqwik's implementation to make tests for this property.\npublic class PropertyTest {\n\n  @Property\n  void stringConcatenation(@ForAll String s1, @ForAll String s2) {\n    String s3 = s1 + s2;\n\n    Assertions.assertEquals(s1.length() + s2.length(), s3.length());\n  }\n}\n\nconcatenationLength had the Property annotation, so QuickCheck will generate random values for s1 and s2 and execute the test with those values.\nProperty-based testing changes the way we automate our tests.\nWe have only been automating the execution of our tests; the design and instantiation of test cases were always done by us, testers.\nWith property-based testing, by means of QuickCheck's implementation, we also automatically generate the inputs of the tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that, in the video, we still use the @RunWith annotation that was required in JUnit 4 (back then, we also used the QuickCheck framework, and not jqwik. The code in this chapter was updated to jqwik, which natively supports JUnit 5. Nevertheless, the underlying idea is still the same.\n\nOther examples\nSuppose the following requirement:\n\nRequirement: Passing grade\nA student passes an exam if s/he gets a grade >= 5.0. \nGrades below that are a fail.\nGrades range from [1.0, 10.0].\n\nWe can identify two valid classes and one invalid class in the requirement: passing grades and non passing grades, and grades outside the range.\nWhen doing property-based testing, we declare these properties in form of jqwik's properties:\n\nThe pass property: for all floats, ranging from 1 (inclusive) to 5.0 (exclusive), the program should return false.\nThe fail property: for all floats, ranging from 5 (inclusive) to 10 (inclusive), the program should return true.\nThe invalid property: for all invalid grades (which we define as any number below 0.9 or greater than 10.1), the program must throw an exception.\n\npublic class PassingGradesPBTest {\n\n    private final PassingGrade pg = new PassingGrade();\n\n    @Property\n    void pass(@ForAll @FloatRange(min = 1f, max = 5.0f, maxIncluded = false) float grade) {\n        assertThat(pg.passed(grade)).isFalse();\n    }\n\n    @Property\n    void fail(@ForAll @FloatRange(min = 5.0f, max = 10.0f, maxIncluded = false) float grade) {\n        assertThat(pg.passed(grade)).isTrue();\n    }\n\n    @Property\n    void invalid(@ForAll(\"invalidGrades\") float grade) {\n        assertThatThrownBy(() -> {\n            pg.passed(grade);\n        })\n        .isInstanceOf(IllegalArgumentException.class);\n    }\n\n    @Provide\n    private Arbitrary invalidGrades() {\n        return Arbitraries.oneOf(\n                Arbitraries.floats().lessOrEqual(-0.9f),\n                Arbitraries.floats().greaterOrEqual(10.1f));\n    }\n}\n\nSee another requirement, also used as an example in jqwik's website:\n\nRequirement: FizzBuzz\nThe program must return 'Fizz' to multiples of 3, \n'Buzz' to multiples of 5,\nand 'FizzBuzz' to multiples of 3 and 5.\nThe program must throw an exception for numbers below 0 (inclusive).\n\nWe can derive four clear properties:\n\nProperty fizz: for all numbers divisible by 3, and not divisible by 5, the program returns fizz (see the divisibleBy3 provider method to understand how we feed values with such properties).\nProperty buzz: for all numbers divisible by 5 (and not divisible by 3), the program returns fizz.\nProperty fizzbuzz: for all numbers divisible by 3 and 5, the program returns fizzbuzz.\nProperty noZeroesAndNegatives: the program throws an exception for all numbers that are zero or smaller.\n\npublic class FizzBuzzTest {\n\n    private final FizzBuzz fb = new FizzBuzz();\n\n    @Property\n    boolean fizz(@ForAll(\"divisibleBy3\") int i) {\n        return fb.fizzbuzz(i).equals(\"Fizz\");\n    }\n\n

Arbitraries.integers().lessOrEqual(0);\n    }\n}\n\nYou may see other examples in our code repository.\nProperty-based testing and AI\nA lot of today's research goes into creating AI for software testing that generates good input values for tests.\nWe try to apply artificial intelligence to find inputs that exercise important parts of the system.\nWhile the research's results are very promising, there still exist difficulties with this testing approach.\nThe main problem is that if the AI generates random inputs, how do we know for sure that the outcome is correct, i.e., how do we know that the problem behaved correctly for that random value?\nWith the unit test we made so far we manually took certain inputs, thought about the correct outcome, and made the assertion to expect that outcome.\nWhen generating random inputs, we cannot think about the outcome every time.\nThe pre- and postconditions, contracts, and properties we discussed in this chapter can help us solve the problem.\nBy well-defining the system in these terms, we can use them as oracles in the test cases.\nThe properties always have to be true, so we can use them in all the randomly generated test cases.\nWe will discuss AI techniques more in a future chapter.\nExercises\n\nWrite property-based tests for all the exercises we discussed in the domain testing chapters and appendix.\n\n"},"chapters/pragmatic-testing/":{"url":"chapters/pragmatic-testing/","title":"Pragmatic software testing","keywords":"","body":"Pragmatic testing\nWhile software testing is an essential

When we test units in isolation, we are doing what is called unit testing.\nDefining a 'unit' is challenging and highly dependent on the context.\nA unit can be just one method or can consist of multiple classes.\nHere is a definition for unit testing by Roy Osherove:\n\n\"A unit test is an automated piece of code that invokes a unit of work in the system.\nAnd a unit of work can span a single method, a whole class or multiple classes working together to achieve one single logical purpose that can be verified.\"\n\nAs with any testing strategy, unit testing has advantages and disadvantages.\nAdvantages\n\nFirstly, unit tests are fast.\nA unit test usually takes just a couple of milliseconds to execute.\nFast tests give us the ability to test huge portions of the system in a small amount of time.\nFast, automated test suites give developers constant feedback; this fast safety net makes developers feel more comfortable and confident in performing evolutionary changes to the software system they are working on.\n\nSecondly, unit tests are easy to control. \nA unit test tests the software by giving certain parameters to a method and then comparing the return value of this method to the expected result.\nThe input values and expected result values are easy to adapt or modify in the test.\n\nFinally, unit tests are easy to write.\nUnit tests do not require complicated setup or additional work. A single unit is also\noften cohesive and small, making the job of the tester easier.\n\n\nDisadvantages\n\nUnit tests lack \"reality\".\nA software system is rarely composed of a single class.\nThe large number of classes in a system and the interaction between these classes can cause the system to behave differently in its real application than in the unit tests.\nTherefore, unit tests do not perfectly represent the real execution of a software system.\n\nSome types of bugs are not caught. \nSome types of bugs cannot be caught at unit test level. They only happen in the integration of the different components (which are not exercised in a pure unit test).\n\n\nSystem testing\nUnit tests do not exercise the system in its entirety (but this is not their goal).\nTo get a more realistic view of the software, and thus perform more realistic tests, \nwe should run the entire software system, with all its \ndatabases, front-end apps, and any other components it has.\nWhen we test the system in its entirety, we are doing what is called \"system testing\".\nIn practice, instead of testing small parts of the system in isolation, system tests exercise the system as a whole.\nNote that an alternative name for system testing is black box testing because the system is a kind of black box.\nIn other words, we do not care or actually know what goes on inside of the system (\"the black box\") as long as we get the expected output for a given input.\nAdvantages\n\nThe obvious advantage of system testing is how realistic the tests are.\nAfter all,\nthe more realistic the tests are, the greater the chance that the system works when shipped.\n\nSystem tests also capture the user's perspective better than unit tests.\nIn other words, system tests are a better simulation of how the final user interacts with the system.\n\n\nDisadvantages\nSystem testing does, however, have its downsides.\n\nSystem tests are often slow when compared to unit tests.\nAlthough we have not written any system test up until now, try to imagine what all a system test has to do, including starting and running the whole system with all its components. The test also has to interact with the real application and actions might take a few seconds to happen.\nImagine a test that starts a container with a web application and another container with a database. It then submits an HTTP request to a webservice that is exposed by this web app. This webservice\nthen retrieves data from the database and writes a JSON response to the test.\nThis obviously takes more time than running a simple unit test, which has virtually no dependencies.\n\nSystem tests are also harder to write.\nSome of the components (e.g., databases) might require complex setup before they can be used in a testing scenario. Think of not only connection and authentication, but also making sure that the database has all the data that is required by that\ntest case. This takes additional code that is needed just for automating the tests.\n\nLastly, system tests tend to become flaky.\nA flaky test is a test that presents an erratic behaviour: if you run it, it might pass or it might fail for the same configuration. Flaky tests are an important problem for software development teams. After all, having a test that might pass when there is a bug or one that might fail when there is none harms the productivity of the development team.\nIt is easy to imagine how a system test can become flaky. Think of a system test that exercises a web app. After clicking a button, the HTTP POST request to the web app took half a second more than usual (due to small variations we often do not control in real-life scenarios; Tomcat decided to do a full garbage collection at that very second, for example). The test was not expecting it to happen and thus, it failed. If the test is executed again, the web app might now take its usual time to respond and the test will pass on this try. There are just too many uncertainties in a system test that\ncan lead to unexpected behaviour.\n\n\n We discuss flaky tests more formally later in the book. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegration testing\nUnit and system testing are the two extremes of test levels.\nAs we saw, unit tests focus on the smallest parts of the system \nwhile system tests focus on the whole system at once.\nHowever, sometimes we need something in between.\nIntegration testing is the test level we use when we need something more\nintegrated (or less isolated) than a unit test but without the need of exercising\nthe entire system.\nLet us look at a real-world integration test example:\n\nSoftware systems commonly rely on database systems. To communicate with the database, developers often create a class whose only responsibility is to interact with this external component (think of Data Access Objects - DAO - classes). These DAOs might contain complicated SQL code. Thus, a tester feels the need to\ntest these SQL queries.\nHowever, note that the tester does not want to test the entire system, only the integration between the DAO class and the database. The tester also does not want to test the DAO class in complete isolation; after all, the best way to know whether a SQL query works is to actually submit it to the database and see what the database returns back. This is an example of an integration test.\n\nThe goal of integration testing is to test multiple components of a system together, focusing on the interactions between them instead of testing the system as a whole.\nAre they communicating correctly? What happens if component A sends message X to component B? \nDo they still present correct behaviour?\nAdvantages\nThe advantage of integration tests is that, while not fully isolated, devising tests \njust for a specific integration is easier than devising tests for all the components together. \nTherefore, the effort of writing such tests\nis a little more than the effort required for unit tests but less than the effort for system tests.\nDisadvantages\nNote that the more integrated our tests are, the more difficult they are to write. \nIn the example, setting up a database for the test requires effort.\nTests that involve databases usually need to:\n\nmake use of an isolated instance of the database just for testing purposes (as you \nprobably do not want your tests to mess with production data),\nupdate the database schema (in fast companies, database schemas are changing all the time, and the test database needs to keep up),\nput the database into a state expected by the test by adding or removing rows,\nand clean everything afterwards (so that the next tests do not fail because of the data that was left behind by the previous test).\n\nThe same effort happens to any other type of integration test you can imagine (e.g., web services, file reads and writes, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Testing Pyramid\nWe discussed three different test levels: unit, system, and integration. \nA question that pragmatic software developers might ask themselves is:\nHow much should I do of each?\nTesters have to decide whether to invest more in unit testing or in system testing as well as determine which components should be tested via unit testing and which components should be tested via system testing. A wrong decision might have a considerable impact on the quality of the system: a wrong level might cost too much resources and might not find sufficient bugs.\nWhile we still have no clear empirical answer to this question, practitioners have been\nproposing different ways to make this decision.\nOne of the most famous diagrams that help us in this discussion \nis the so-called testing pyramid.\n\nThe diagram indicates all the test levels we discussed, plus manual testing. \nNote that as you climb the levels in the diagram, the tests become more realistic. At the same time, the tests also become more complex on the higher levels.\nHow much should we do of each then? \nThe common practice in industry is also represented by the diagram. The size of the pyramid slice represents the number of tests one would want to carry out at each test level. \nUnit testing is at the bottom of the pyramid and has the largest area of them all. This means that testers should favour unit testing.\nThe reasons for this have been discussed before: they are fast, require less effort to be written, and give developers more control.\nAs we climb up the levels on the diagram, we see that the next level is integration testing. The area is a bit smaller, indicating that in practice, we should do integration tests less than unit tests.\nGiven the extra effort that integration tests require,\ntesters should make sure to write tests only for the integrations they really need.\nThe diagram continues, showing that testers should then favour system tests less than integration tests and even less manual tests.\nIt is clear that this diagram focuses on costs. Unit tests are cheaper than system tests (and manual tests), and therefore they should be preferred.\nThe next question is: how do I decide whether a component should be tested at the unit- or system-level?. Practitioners have devised guidelines, which we present below but it should be noted that this is not a universal rule as every software system is different to other systems, and might require specific guidelines.\nWhen to write unit tests?\n\nWhen the component is about an algorithm or a single piece of business logic of the software system.\n\nIf we think of enterprise/business systems, most of them are about \"transforming data\". Such business logics is often expressed by means of entity classes (e.g., an Invoice class and a Order class) exchanging messages.\nBusiness logic often does not depend on external services and so it can easily be tested and fully exercised by means of unit tests. Unit tests give testers full control in terms of the input data, as well as full observability in terms of asserting that the behaviour was as expected.\nIf you have a piece of code that deals with specific business logic but you are not able to test it via unit tests (e.g., it is only possible to exercise that business logic with the full system running), it is probably because of previous design or architectural decisions that prevent you from writing unit tests.\nThe way you design your classes has a high impact on how easy it is to write unit tests for your code. We discuss more about design for testability in a future chapter.\nWhen to write integration tests?\n\nWhenever the component under test interacts with an external component (e.g., a database or a web service) integration tests are appropriate.\n\nFollowing our example in the integration testing section, a Data Access Object class is better tested at the integration level.\nAgain, note that integration tests are more expensive and harder to set up than a unit test. Therefore making sure that the component that performs the integration is solely responsible for that integration and nothing else (i.e., no business rules together with integration code), will reduce the cost of the testing.\nWhen to write system tests?\nAs we know, system tests are very costly. This makes it impossible for testers to re-test their entire system at system level. Therefore, the suggestion here is to use a risk-based approach. What are the absolutely critical parts of the software system under test? In other words, what are the parts of the system on which a bug would have a high impact? These are the ones where the tester should focus on with system tests.\nOf course, such critical parts must also be tested at other levels. Remember the pesticide paradox: a single technique is usually not enough to identify all the bugs.\nWhen to perform manual tests?\nManual testing has lots of disadvantages, but is sometimes impossible to avoid. Even in cases where automation is fully possible, manual exploratory testing can be useful. \nThe Wikipedia page on Exploratory Testing is well written and we point the reader to it.\nOn the other hand, those who apply the testing pyramid try to avoid the so-called ice-cream cone anti-pattern. Imagine the testing pyramid upside down.\nIn this new version, manual testing has the largest area, which means more effort on manual testing (!!).\n\nAt this point, we do not have to explain why relying fully on manual testing is a bad thing. Unfortunately, it is common to see development teams relying mostly on manual tests in their quality assurance processes. Often, these teams also have a small number of system tests. This is not because they believe system tests are more efficient, but because the system was badly designed, so that it is impossible to carry out unit and integration tests.\nWe will discuss design for testability in future chapters.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe community of practice and the testing pyramid\nWe have no scientific evidence that the testing pyramid or the idea\nof prioritising design for testability and focusing on unit tests is efficient.\nHowever, the software development community has relied on it for years, and small and larger companies have been advocating it.\nThat being said, in our point of view, the testing pyramid approach is viable in most enterprise / business systems. Imagine an ERP or a CRM system. Most business rules there can be expressed by classes/units which exchange messages and transform data. Unit tests will then deliver benefits as testers can easily gain control and observability of the actions of the system.\nHowever, in many other systems, unit testing might not be enough. Imagine the development of a database management system itself (e.g., MySQL, Oracle, or a distributed computing system like Hadoop). While MySQL's code probably contains lots of individual components that can be unit tested, a lot happens at \"low-level\" - like disk I/O or socket communication. In these cases, system tests may be the ones that would reveal most of the important bugs. \nThe same might happen with cyber-physical systems. Imagine a water management station.\nAlthough a lot of software is used there, the system depends highly on physical constraints, such as the dynamics of water that affect the reading of the water level sensors. In such situations, it can be challenging or even unrealistic to write unit tests.\nThe message here is that although the testing pyramid makes sense in lots of systems that are developed in industry, for some others it might not be the best way of making trade-offs. You, as a tester, should understand the advantages and the disadvantages of each test level, their benefits and costs,\nand then decide which test levels to use, how much, and when. There is no silver bullet.\nThe testing pyramid at Google\nIn \"Software Engineeging at Google\", authors mention that Google often opts for unit tests, as they tend to be cheaper to be developed, and execute faster. Similarly to the testing pyramid, integration and system tests also happen, although in less scale. According to the authors, around 80% of their tests are unit tests.\nGoogle has also an interesting definition of \"test sizes\", that engineers also take into consideration when designing test cases:\n\nA \"small test\" is a test that can be executed in a single process. In other words, imagine that a tester wants to test a method in a class. This method makes no use of external components and/or threads and parallelism. This is a \"small test\". Their advantages is that such tests do not have access to main sources of test slowness or determinism; in other words, they are fast and not flaky.\n\nA \"medium test\" can span multiple processes, use threads, and can make external calls (like network calls) to localhost. Integration tests to databases, as we discussed before, could be classified as a medium test, if the database also runs in the same machine as the tests. Clearly, medium tests tend to be somewhat slower and more flaky than small tests.\n\nFinally, \"large tests\" remove the localhost restriction. Large tests can then require and make calls to multiple machines. Google reserves large tests for full end-to-end tests.\n\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nHere is a skeleton for the testing pyramid.\nFill in the correct corresponding terms.\n\n(Try to answer the question without scrolling up!)\nExercise 2.\nAs a tester, you have to decide which test level (i.e., unit, integration, or system test) you will apply.\nWhich of the following statements is true?\n\nIntegration tests, although more complicated (in terms of automation) than unit tests, would provide more help in finding bugs in the communication with the webservice and/or the communication with the database.\nGiven that unit tests could be easily written (by using mocks) and they would cover as much as integration tests would, unit tests are the best option for this problem.\nThe most effective way to find bugs in this code is through system tests. In this case, the tester should run the entire system and exercise the batch process. Given that this code can be easily mocked, system tests would also be cheap.\nWhile all the test levels can be used for this problem, testers are more likely to find more bugs if they choose one level and explore all the possibilities and corner cases there.\n\nExercise 3.\nThe tester should now write an integration test for the OrderDao class below.\npublic class OrderDeliveryBatch {\n\n  public void runBatch() {\n\n    OrderDao dao = new OrderDao();\n    DeliveryStartProcess delivery = new DeliveryStartProcess();\n\n    List orders = dao.paidButNotDelivered();\n\n    for(Order order : orders) {\n      delivery.start(order);\n\n      if(order.isInternational()) {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"5 days from now\");\n      } else {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"2 days from now\");\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass OrderDao {\n  // accesses a database\n}\n\nclass DeliveryStartProcess {\n  // communicates with a third-party webservice\n}\n\nWhich one of the following statements is not required when writing\nan integration test for this class?\n\nReset the database state before each test.\nApply the correct schema to the database under test.\nAssert that all database constraints are met.\nSet the transaction auto-commit to true.\n\nExercise 4.\nA newly developed product started off with some basic unit tests but later on decided to add only integration and system tests for the new code that was written. This was because a user interacts with the system as a whole and therefore these types of tests were considered more valuable. Therefore unit tests became less prevalent, while integration and system tests became a more crucial part of the test suite. Which of the following describes this transition?\n\nTransitioning from a testing pyramid to an ice-cream cone pattern\nTransitioning from an ice-cream cone anti-pattern to a testing pyramid\nTransitioning form an ice-cream cone pattern to a testing pyramid\nTransitioning from a testing pyramid to an ice-cream cone anti-pattern\n\nExercise 5.\nTU Delft just built in-house software to handle the payroll of its employees. The application makes use of Java web technologies and stores data in a Postgres database. The application frequently retrieves, modifies, and inserts large amounts of data into the database. All this communication is made by Java classes that send (complex) SQL queries to the database. \nAs testers, we know that a bug can be anywhere, including in the SQL queries themselves. We also know that there are many ways to exercise our system. Which one of the following is not a good option to detect bugs in the SQL queries?\n\nUnit testing\nIntegration testing\nSystem testing\nStress testing\n\nExercise 6.\nChoosing the level of a test is a matter of a trade-off. After all, each \ntest level has advantages and disadvantages.\nWhich one of the following is the main advantage of a test at system level?\n\nThe interaction with the system is much closer to reality.\nIn a continuous integration environment, system tests provide real feedback to developers.\nGiven that system tests are never flaky, they provide developers with more stable feedback.\nA system test is written by product owners, making it closer to reality.\n\nExercise 7.\nWhat is the main reason for the number of recommended system tests in the testing pyramid to be smaller than the number of unit tests?\n\nUnit tests are as good as system tests.\nSystem tests do not provide developers with enough quality feedback.\nThere are no good tools for system tests.\nSystem tests tend to be slow and often are non-deterministic.\n\nReferences\n\nChapter 2 of the Foundations of software testing: ISTQB certification.

Other parts of the system that depend on this InvoiceDAO class, then also depend (directly or indirectly) on a database. We therefore also have a dependency on the database when we write tests for those other parts, even though our focus might not even be the database part of the system. As we saw before, this can incur higher testing costs.\nIn other words: we want to unit test a component A, that depends on another component B. The dependency on component B increases the costs of unit testing A.\nThis is where test doubles come in handy. The idea is that we will create an object that will mimic the behaviour of component B (\"it looks like B, but it is not B\"). Given that we have full control over what this \"fake component B\" does, we can design it in such a way that unit testing A becomes less costly. In our example above, suppose that A is a plain Java class and B is a Data Access Object (and thus, it communicates with the database). If we simulate B for example by returning a hard-coded list of two elements whenever the findAllInvoices() method is called, instead of going to the database, we remove the need for a database when testing A. \nIf this seems too abstract, the source code we show later in this chapter offers more clarification.\nThe use of objects that simulate the behaviour of other objects has advantages:\n\nFirstly we have more control. We can easily tell these objects what to do, without the need for complicated setups. If we want a method to throw an exception, we just tell the mock method to throw it; there is no need for complicated setups to \"force\" the dependency to throw the exception. Similarly, if we want a method that returns a Calendar object representing a date in 2009, we just tell the mock method to do it; there is no need to complicate your OS in order to make it go back in time. Note how hard it usually is to \"force\" a class to throw an exception, or to \"force\" a class to return a fake date. This effort is close to zero when we simulate the dependencies with mock objects. \n\nSimulations are also faster. Imagine a dependency that communicates with a webservice or a database. A method in one of these classes might take a few seconds to process. On the other hand, if we simulate the dependency, it will no longer need to communicate with a database or with a webservice anymore and wait for a response; the simulation will simply return what it was configured to return, and it will cost nothing in terms of time.  \n\n\nSimulating dependencies is therefore a widely used technique in software testing, mainly to increase testability.\nSuch objects are also known as test doubles. In the rest of this chapter, we will:\n\nExplain the differences between dummies, fakes, stubs, spies, and mocks.\nLearn Mockito, a popular mocking framework in Java. Although Mockito has \"mock\" in the name, Mockito can be used for stubbing and spying as well. We also show, by means of a few examples, how simulations can help developers in writing unit tests more effectively.\nDiscuss interaction testing and how mocks can be used as a design technique.\nDiscuss what Google has learned about test doubles.\n\nDummies, fakes, stubs, spies, and mocks\nMeszaros, in his book, defines five different types: dummy objects, fake objects, stubs, spies, and mocks:\n\nDummy objects: Objects that are passed to the class under test, but are never really used. This is common in business applications, where in many cases you need to fill a long list of parameters, but the test only exercises a few of them. Think of a unit test for a Customer class. Maybe this class depends on several other classes (Address, Last Order, etc). But a specific test case A wants to exercise the \"last order business rule\", and does not care much about which Address this Customer has. In this case, a tester would then set up a dummy Address object and pass it to the Customer class.\n\nFake objects: Fake objects have real working implementations of the class they simulate. However, they usually do the same task in a much simpler way. Imagine a fake database class that uses an array list instead of a real database.\n\nStubs: Stubs provide hard-coded answers to the calls that are performed during the test. \nStubs do not actually have a working implementation, as fake objects do. In the examples above, where we used the word \"simulation\", we were actually talking about stub objects. Stubs do not know what to do if the test calls a method for which it was not programmed and/or set up. \n\nSpies: As the name suggests, spies \"spy\" a dependency. It wraps itself around the object and observes its behaviour. Strictly speaking it does not actually simulate the object, but rather just delegates all interactions to the underlying object while recording information about these interactions. Imagine you just need to know how many times a method X is called in a dependency: that is when a spy would come in handy.\n\nMocks: Mock objects act like stubs that are pre-configured ahead of time to know what kind of interactions should occur with them. For example, imagine a mock object that is configured as follows: method A should be called twice and, for the first call it should return \"1\", and for the second call it should throw an exception, while method B should never be called.\n\n\nAs a tester, you should decide which test double to use. We will discuss some guidelines later.\nMockito\nOne of the most popular Java mocking/stubbing frameworks is Mockito (mockito.org). Mockito has a very simple API. Developers can set up stubs and/or define expectations in mock objects with just a few lines of code.\nThe most important methods one needs to know from Mockito are:\n\nmock(): creates a mock object/stub of a given class. The class can be retrieved from any class by .class.\nwhen(.).thenReturn(): defines the behaviour when the given method is called on the mock. In this case  will be returned.\nverify().: asserts that the mock object was exercised in the expected way for the given method.\n\nMockito is an extensive framework and we will only cover part of it in this chapter. To learn more, take a look at its documentation.\nStubbing\nLet us learn how to use Mockito and setup stubs with a practical example.\n\nRequirement: Low value invoices\nThe program must return all the issued invoices with values smaller than 100. The collection of invoices can be found in our database.\n\nThe following is a possible implementation of this requirement. Note that the\nIssuedInvoices is a class responsible for retrieving all the invoices from the database.\nimport java.util.List;\nimport static java.util.stream.Collectors.toList;\n\npublic class InvoiceFilter {\n\n  public List lowValueInvoices() {\n    final var issuedInvoices = new IssuedInvoices();\n    try {\n      return issuedInvoices.all().stream()\n              .filter(invoice -> invoice.value \nWithout stubbing the IssueInvoices class, the InvoiceFilter test would need to also handle the database (making the unit testing more expensive). Note how the tests need to open and close the connection (see the open() and closeDao() methods) and save invoices to the database (see the many calls to invoices.save() in the filterInvoices test).\npublic class InvoiceFilterTest {\n  private IssuedInvoices invoices;\n\n  @BeforeEach public void open() {\n    invoices = new IssuedInvoices();\n  }\n\n  @AfterEach public void closeDao() {\n    if (invoices != null) invoices.close();\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  void filterInvoices() {\n    final var mauricio = new Invoice(\"Mauricio\", 20);\n    final var steve = new Invoice(\"Steve\", 99);\n    final var arie = new Invoice(\"Arie\", 300);\n\n    invoices.save(mauricio);\n    invoices.save(steve);\n    invoices.save(arie);\n\n    final InvoiceFilter filter = new InvoiceFilter();\n\n    assertThat(filter.lowValueInvoices()).containsExactlyInAnyOrder(mauricio, steve);\n  }\n\n}\n\nThis test is not even complete. We also need to reset the database after every test. Otherwise, the test will fail in its second run, as there will now be four invoices with an amount smaller than 100 stored in the database! Remember that the database stores data permanently. So far, we never had to \"clean our mess\" in test code, as all the objects we created were always stored in-memory only.\nDid you notice the assertThat...containsExactlyInAnyOrder assertion we used? This ensures that the list contains exactly the objects we pass, and in any order.\nSuch assertions do not come with JUnit 5. These assertions are part of the AssertJ project. AssertJ is a fluent assertions API for Java, giving us several interesting assertions that are especially useful when dealing with lists or complex objects. We recommend you get familiar with it!\n\nLet us now re-write the test. This time we will stub the IssuedInvoices class.\nFor that to happen, we first need to make sure the stub can be \"injected\" into the InvoiceFilter class. If you look at the previous implementation of the InvoiceFilter class, you will notice that the class instantiates the IssuedInvoices class on its own. If we are to use a stub, the class should allow the stub to be injected.\nIt suffices to pass the dependency to the constructor, instead of instantiating it directly:\nimport java.util.List;\nimport static java.util.stream.Collectors.toList;\n\npublic class InvoiceFilter {\n\n  final IssuedInvoices issuedInvoices;\n\n  public InvoiceFilter(IssuedInvoices issuedInvoices) {\n    this.issuedInvoices = issuedInvoices;\n  }\n  public List lowValueInvoices() {\n      return issuedInvoices.all().stream()\n              .filter(invoice -> invoice.value \nLet us now stub IssuedInvoices. Note that now our test does not need to do anything that is related to databases. The full control of the stub enables us to try different cases (even exceptional ones) very quickly:\nimport static java.util.Arrays.asList;\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\nimport static org.mockito.Mockito.when;\n\npublic class InvoiceFilterTest {\n    private final IssuedInvoices invoices = Mockito.mock(IssuedInvoices.class);\n    private final InvoiceFilter filter = new InvoiceFilter(issuedInvoices);\n\n    @Test\n    void filterInvoices() {\n      final var mauricio = new Invoice(\"Mauricio\", 20);\n      final var steve = new Invoice(\"Steve\", 99);\n      final var arie = new Invoice(\"Arie\", 300);\n\n      when(issuedInvoices.all()).thenReturn(asList(mauricio, arie, steve));\n\n      assertThat(filter.lowValueInvoices()).containsExactlyInAnyOrder(mauricio, steve);\n    }\n\n}\n\nNote how we setup the stub, using Mockito's when method. In this example, we tell the stub to return a list containing mauricio, arie, and steve (the three invoices we instantiate as part of the test case). The test then invokes the method under test, filter.lowValueInvoices(). As a consequence, the method under test invokes issuedInvoices.all(). However, at this point, issuedInvoices is actually a stub that returns the list with the three invoices. The method under test continues its execution, returns a new list with only the two invoices that are below 100, causing the assertion to pass.\nNote that, besides making the test easier to write, the use of stubs also made the test class more cohesive. The InvoiceFilterTest only tests the InvoiceFilter class. It does not test the usage of the IssueInvoices class. Clearly, IssueInvoices deserves to be tested, but in another place, and by means of an integration test.\nNote that a cohesive test has less chances of failing because of something else. In the old version, the filterInvoices test could fail because of a bug in the InvoiceFilter class or because of a bug in the IssuedInvoices class. The new tests can now only fail because of a bug in the InvoiceFilter class, and never because of IssuedInvoices. This is handy, as a developer will spend less time debugging in case this test starts to fail.\nOur new approach for testing InvoiceFilter is faster, easier to write, and more cohesive.\nMocks and expectations\nSuppose our system has a new requirement:\n\nRequirement: Send low valued invoices to SAP\nAll low valued invoices should be sent to our SAP system.\nSAP offers a /sendInvoice webservice that receives invoices.\n\nLet us follow the idea of using test doubles to facilitate the development of our production and test code. To that aim, let us create a SAP interface that represents the communication with SAP:\npublic interface SAP {\n  void send(Invoice invoice);\n}\n\nWe now need a class that will coordinate the process: retrieve the low valued invoices from the InvoiceFilterand pass them to the SAP service. Let us create a new SAPInvoiceSender class:\npublic class SAPInvoiceSender {\n\n  private final InvoiceFilter filter;\n  private final SAP sap;\n\n  public SAPInvoiceSender(InvoiceFilter filter, SAP sap) {\n    this.filter = filter;\n    this.sap = sap;\n  }\n\n  public void sendLowValuedInvoices() {\n    filter\n      .lowValueInvoices()\n      .forEach(invoice -> sap.send(invoice));\n  }\n}\n\nLet us now test the SAPInvoiceSender class.\nNote that, for this test, we now mock the InvoiceFilter class. After all, for the SAPInvoiceSender, InvoiceFilter class is \"just a class that returns a list of invoices\". As it is not the goal of the current test to test the filter itself, we should mock this class, in order to facilitate the testing of the method under test.\nAfter the execution of the method under test (sendLowValuedInvoices()), we \nshould expect that the SAP mock received mauricio's, steve's, and aries invoices. For that, we use Mockito's verify() method:\npublic class SAPInvoiceSenderTest {\n\n  private static final InvoiceFilter filter = mock(InvoiceFilter.class);\n  private static final SAP sap = mock(SAP.class);\n  private static final SAPInvoiceSender sender = new SAPInvoiceSender(filter, sap);\n\n  @Test\n  void sendToSap() {\n    final var mauricio = new Invoice(\"Mauricio\", 20);\n    final var steve = new Invoice(\"Steve\", 99);\n    final var arie = new Invoice(\"Arie\", 300);\n\n    when(filter.lowValueInvoices()).thenReturn(asList(mauricio, steve, arie));\n\n    sender.sendLowValuedInvoices();\n\n    verify(sap).send(mauricio);\n    verify(sap).send(steve);\n    verify(sap).send(arie);\n  }\n}\n\nNote how we defined the expectations of the mock object. We \"knew\" exactly how the InvoiceFilter class had to interact with the mock. When the test is executed, Mockito will check whether these expectations were met, and fail the test if they were not. (If you want to test it, simply comment out the forEach... line in the sendLowValuedInvoices and see the test failing).\nThis example illustrates the main difference between stubbing and mocking. Stubbing means simply returning hard-coded values for a given method call. Mocking means not only defining what methods do, but also explicitly defining how the interactions with the mock should be.\nMockito actually enables us to define even more specific expectations. For example, see the expectations below:\nverify(sap, times(3)).send(any(Invoice.class));\nverify(sap, times(1)).send(mauricio);\nverify(sap, times(1)).send(steve);\nverify(sap, times(1)).send(arie);\n\nThese expectations are more restrictive than the ones we had before.\nWe now expect the SAP mock to have its send method invoked precisely three times (for any given Invoice). We then expect the send method to called once for the mauricio invoice, once for the steve invoice, and once for the arie invoice. We point the reader to Mockito's manual for more details on how to configure expectations.\n\nYou might be asking yourself now: Why did you not put this new SAP sending functionality inside of the existing InvoiceFilter class?\nIf we were do it, the lowValueInvoices method would then be both a \"command\" and a \"query\". By \"query\", we mean that the method returns data to the caller while with \"command\", we mean that the method also performs an action in the system. Mixing both concepts in a single method is not a good idea, as it may confuse developers who will eventually call this method. How would they know this method had some extra side-effect, besides just returning the list of invoices?\nIf you want to read more about this, search for Command-Query Separation, or CQS, a concept devised by Bertrand Meyer.\n\nHow to stub static methods (or with APIs you do not control)\nImagine the following requirement:\n\nRequirement: Christmas Discount\nThe program gives a 15% discount on the total amount of an order if the current date is Christmas day. Otherwise there is no discount.\n\nA possible implementation for this requirement is as follows:\npublic class ChristmasDiscount {\n\npublic double applyDiscount(double amount) {\n    Calendar today = Calendar.getInstance();\n\n    double discountPercentage = 0;\n    boolean isChristmas = today.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH) == 25 &&\n          today.get(Calendar.MONTH) == Calendar.DECEMBER;\n\n    if(isChristmas)\n      discountPercentage = 0.15;\n\n    return amount - (amount * discountPercentage);\n  }\n\n}\n\nThe implementation is quite straightforward. And given the characteristics of the class, unit testing seems to be a perfect fit for testing it. The question is: how can we write unit tests for it? To test both cases (i.e., Christmas/not Christmas), we need to be able to control/stub the Calendar class, so that it returns the dates we want.\nWe can then ask a more specific question: how can we stub the Calendar API?\nYou might have noted that the call to Calendar.getInstance() is a static call. Mockito does not allow us to stub static methods (although some other more magical mock frameworks do). Static calls are indeed enemies of testability, as they do not allow for easy stubbing.\nIn such cases, a pragmatic solution is to create an abstraction on top of the static call. The abstraction encapsulates the \"not-so-easy-to-be-stubbed\" method, and offers an \"easy-to-be-stubbed\" method to the rest of the program. For this particular\ncase, a Clock abstraction can do the job:\nimport java.util.Calendar;\n\npublic interface Clock {\n    Calendar now();\n}\n\nWith this interface, we can follow the same approach as before. Let us inject Clock to the ChristmasDiscount class:\nimport java.util.Calendar;\n\npublic class ChristmasDiscount {\n\n  private final Clock clock;\n\n  public ChristmasDiscount(Clock clock) {\n    this.clock = clock;\n  }\n\n  public double applyDiscount(double rawAmount) {\n    Calendar today = clock.now();\n\n    double discountPercentage = 0;\n    boolean isChristmas = today.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH) == 25 &&\n          today.get(Calendar.MONTH) == Calendar.DECEMBER;\n\n    if(isChristmas)\n      discountPercentage = 0.15;\n\n    return rawAmount - (rawAmount * discountPercentage);\n  }\n}\n\nWith Clock being an interface, we can stub it the way we want and/or need:\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\nimport org.mockito.Mockito;\nimport java.util.Calendar;\nimport java.util.GregorianCalendar;\nimport static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;\nimport static org.mockito.Mockito.when;\n\npublic class ChristmasDiscountTest {\n\n    private final Clock clock = Mockito.mock(Clock.class);\n    private final ChristmasDiscount cd = new ChristmasDiscount(clock);\n\n    @Test\n    public void christmas() {\n      Calendar christmas = new GregorianCalendar(2015, Calendar.DECEMBER, 25);\n      when(clock.now()).thenReturn(christmas);\n\n      double finalValue = cd.applyDiscount(100.0);\n      assertEquals(85.0, finalValue, 0.0001);\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void notChristmas() {\n      Calendar christmas = new GregorianCalendar(2015, Calendar.JANUARY, 25);\n      when(clock.now()).thenReturn(christmas);\n\n      double finalValue = cd.applyDiscount(100.0);\n      assertEquals(100.0, finalValue, 0.0001);\n    }\n}\n\nNote again that we were able to develop the main logic of the requirement without depending on the concrete implementation of Clock. For completeness, let us implement Clock:\npublic class DefaultClock implements Clock {\n    @Override\n    public Calendar now() {\n      return Calendar.getInstance();\n    }\n}\n\nCreating abstractions on top of dependencies that you do not own, as a way to gain more control, is a common technique among developers.\nOne might ask: Won't that increase the overall complexity of my system? After all, it requires maintaining another abstraction? Yes. There is more complexity when we add new abstractions in our software, and that is what we are doing here. However, the point is: does the ease in testing the system that we get from adding this abstraction compensate for the cost of the increased complexity? Often, the answer is yes, it does pay off.\nWhen to mock/stub?\nMocks and stubs are a useful tool when it comes to ease the process of writing unit tests. However, as expected mocking too much might also be problem. We do not want to mock a dependency that should not be mocked. Imagine you are testing class A, which depends on a class B. Should we mock/stub B?\nPragmatically, developers often mock/stub the following types of dependencies:\n\nDependencies that are too slow: If the dependency is too slow, for any reason, it might be a good idea to simulate that dependency.\n\nDependencies that communicate with external infrastructure: If the dependency talks to (external) infrastructure, it might be too complex to be set up. Consider stubbing it.\n\nHard to simulate cases: If we want to force the dependency to behave in a hard-to-simulate way, mocks/stubs can help. A common example is when we would like the dependency to throw an exception. Forcing an exception in the real dependency might be tricky, but easy to do in a stub/mock.\n\n\nOn the other hand, developers tend not to mock/stub:\n\nEntities. An entity is a simple class that mirrors a collection in a database, while instances of this class mirror the entries of that collection. In Java we tend to call these POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects), as they mostly consist of fields only. In business systems, it is quite common that entities depend on other entities, e.g., a Order depends on OrderItem. When testing Order, developers tend not to stub OrderItem. The reason is that OrderItem is probably also a well-contained class that is easy to set up. Mocking it would take more time than the actual implementation would take. Exceptions can be made for heavy entities.\n\nNative libraries and utility methods. It is not common to mock/stub libraries that come with our programming language and utility methods. For example, why would one mock ArrayList or a call to String.format? As shown with the Calendar example above, any library or utility methods that harm testability can be abstracted away.\n\n\nUltimately, remember that whenever you mock, you reduce the reality of the test. It is up to you to understand this trade-off.\nMocks as a design technique\nFrom a developer's perspective, the use of mocks enables them to develop their software, without caring too much about external details. Imagine a developer working on the \"low value invoices\" requirement. The developer knows that the invoices will come from the database. However, while developing the main logic of the requirement (i.e., the filtering logic), the developer \"does not care about the database\"; they only care about the list of invoices that will come from it.\nIn other words, the developer only cares about the existence of a method that returns all the existing invoices. In object-oriented languages, that can be represented by means of an interface:\npublic interface IssuedInvoices {\n List\nHaving such an interface, the developer can then proceed to the InvoiceFilter and develop it completely. After all, its implementation never depended on a database, but solely on the issued invoices. Look at it again:\npublic class InvoiceFilter {\n\n  final IssuedInvoices issuedInvoices;\n\n  public InvoiceFilter(IssuedInvoices issuedInvoices) {\n    this.issuedInvoices = issuedInvoices;\n  }\n  public List\nOnce the InvoiceFilter and all its tests are done, the developer can then focus on finally implementing the IssuedInvoices class and its integration tests.\nHence, once you get used to this way of developing, you will notice how your code will become easier to test. We will talk more about design for testability in future chapters.\nMock Roles, Not Objects!\nIn their seminal work Mock Roles, Not Objects, Freeman et al. show how mock objects can be used not as tool to solely support testing, but as a tool to drive the design of the system. In other words, by concentrating on the interactions between objects (achieved through TDD and mock objects), developers can better discover the roles, interfaces, contracts, and expectations of the classes in their software systems.\nIn the following, we summarize some of the best practices on interaction testing, that authors raise in their paper:\n\nOnly mock types you own. Developers should not mock objects that they do not \"own\", e.g., a class from an external library. Rather, they should build abstractions on top of those.\n\nBe explicit about things that should not happen. Writing tests for interactions that should not happen makes intentions clearer.\n\nSpecify as little as possible in the test. Overspecified tests tend to be more brittle. Focus on the interactions that really matter.\n\nDon't use mocks to test boundary objects. Objects that have no relationships to other objects do not need to be mocked. In practice, these objects tend to \"only\" store data or represent atomic values.\n\nDon't add behaviour. Mocks are still stubs, and you should avoid adding any extra behavior on it.\n\nOnly mock your immediate neighbours. Mocking an entire network of objects adds extra complexity to the test. This might be a symptom that the component needs a better design.\n\nAvoid too many mocks. After all, mock objects add complexity to the overall test.\n\n\nThe authors also discuss some common misconception when using mocks:\n\nMocks are just stubs. Mock objects indeed act as stubs. However, their main goal (or, what makes it different from \"just\" stubs) is to assert the interaction of the target object with its neighbours.\n\nMocks should not be used only to the boundaries of the system. Some developers might argue that only classes that are at the boundaries of the system should be mocked (e.g., classes that talk to external systems). Mocks might be even more helpful when used within the system, as the it can also drive developers to better class design.\n\nGather state during the test and assert against it afterwards. Making assertions only at the end of the test makes failing tests less easy to be understood. Favour immediate failures.\n\nTesting using Mock Objects duplicates the code. This often happens when mock objects act purely as a replacement for an external class, rather than to drive the design of the code.\n\n\nTest doubles at Google\nThe \"Software Engineering at Google\" book has an entire chapter dedicated to test doubles. In the following, we provide you with a summary:\n\nUsing test doubles requires the system to be designed for testability. Dependency injection is the common technique to enable test doubles.\nBuilding test doubles that are faithful to the real implementation is challenging. Test doubles have to be as faithful as possible.\nPrefer realism over isolation. When possible, opt for the real implementation, instead of fakes, stubs, or mocks.\nSome trade-offs to consider when deciding whether to use a test double: the execution time of the real implementation, how much non-determinism we would get from using the real implementation.\nWhen using the real implementation is not possible or too costly, prefer fakes over mocks. An in-memory database, for example, might be better (or more real) than a mock.\nExcessive mocking can be dangerous, as tests become unclear (i.e., hard to comprehend), brittle (i.e., might break too often), and less effective (i.e., reduced fault capability detection).\nWhen mocking, prefer state testing rather than iteraction testing. In other words, make sure you are asserting a change of state and/or the consequence of the action under test, rather than the precise interaction that the action has with the mocked object. After all, interaction testing tends to be too coupled with the implementation of the system under test.\nUse interaction testing when state testing is not possible, or when a bad interaction might have an impact in the system (e.g., calling the same method twice would make the system twice as slow).\nAvoid overspecified interaction tests. Focus on the relevant arguments and functions.\nGood interaction testing requires strict guidelines when designing the system under test. Google engineers tend not to do it.\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nSee the following class:\npublic class OrderDeliveryBatch {\n\n  public void runBatch() {\n\n    OrderDao dao = new OrderDao();\n    DeliveryStartProcess delivery = new DeliveryStartProcess();\n\n    List orders = dao.paidButNotDelivered();\n\n    for (Order order : orders) {\n      delivery.start(order);\n\n      if (order.isInternational()) {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"5 days from now\");\n      } else {\n       order.setDeliveryDate(\"2 days from now\");\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass OrderDao {\n  // accesses a database\n}\n\nclass DeliveryStartProcess {\n  // communicates with a third-party webservice\n}\n\nWhich of the following Mockito lines would never appear in a test for the OrderDeliveryBatch class?\n\nOrderDao dao = Mockito.mock(OrderDao.class);\nMockito.verify(delivery).start(order); (assume order is an instance of Order)\nMockito.when(dao.paidButNotDelivered()).thenReturn(list); (assume dao is an instance of OrderDao and list is an instance of List)\nOrderDeliveryBatch batch = Mockito.mock(OrderDeliveryBatch.class);\n\nExercise 2.\nYou are testing a system that triggers advanced events based on complex combinations of Boolean external conditions relating to the weather (outside temperature, amount of rain, wind, ...). \nThe system has been designed cleanly and consists of a set of co-operating classes that each have a single responsibility. You create a decision table for this logic, and decide to test it using mocks. Which is a valid test strategy?\n\nYou use mocks to support observing the external conditions.\nYou create mock objects to represent each variant you need to test.\nYou use mocks to control the external conditions and to observe the event being triggered.\nYou use mocks to control the triggered events.\n\nExercise 3.\nBelow, we show the InvoiceFilter class. This class is responsible for returning the invoices for an amount that is smaller than 100.0. It makes use of the InvoiceDAO class, which is responsible for communication with the database.\npublic class InvoiceFilter {\n\n    private InvoiceDao invoiceDao;\n\n    public InvoiceFilter(InvoiceDao invoiceDao) {\n        this.invoiceDao = invoiceDao;\n    }\n\n    public List filter() {\n        List filtered = new ArrayList<>();\n        List allInvoices = invoiceDao.all();\n\n        for(Invoice inv : allInvoices) {\n            if(inv.getValue() \nWhich of the following statements is false about this class?\n\nIntegration tests would help us achieve a 100% branch coverage, which is not possible solely via unit tests.\nIts implementation allows for dependency injection, which enables mocking.\nIt is possible to write completely isolated unit tests for it by, e.g., using mocks.\nThe InvoiceDao class (a direct dependency of the InvoiceFilter) itself should be tested by means of integration tests.\n\nExercise 4.\nClass A depends on a static method in another class B. If you want to test class A, which of the following two action(s) should you apply to do this properly?\n\nMock class B to control the u of the methods in class B.\nRefactor class A, so the outcome of the method of class B is now used as an parameter.\n\nOnly approach 1.\n\nNeither.\nOnly approach 2.\nBoth.\n\nExercise 5.\nReferring to the previous chapter, apply boundary testing techniques to the InvoiceFilter example discussed in this chapter.\nReferences\n\nFowler, Martin.

The refactoring operation we performed (where we made the class receive its dependencies via constructors) facilitated the testing of the InvoiceFilter class.\nNote, however, that this was not the case at the beginning of that chapter. We had to refactor the code for that to happen.\nSoftware systems are often not ready/prepared to be tested, as seen in the classes in our previous chapter.\nAnd so this chapter will show how to design and build a software system in a way that increases its testability.\nTestability is the term used to describe how easy it is to write automated tests for the system, class, or method to be tested.\nWe already know that automated tests are crucial for high-quality software; it is, therefore, essential that our code is testable.\nIn this chapter, we'll discuss some design practices that increase the testability of software systems. This idea is referred to as design for testability. Specifically it involves:\n\nDependency injection;\nThe separation between domain and infrastructure code;\nImplementation-level tips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependency injection\nDependency injection is a design choice we can use to make our code more testable.\nWe will illustrate what dependency injection is by means of this analogy:\n\nWe need a hammer to perform a certain task.\nWhen we are asked to do this task, we find the hammer by ourselves and once we have the hammer, we use it to perform the task.\nHowever, another approach is to say that, while we still need a hammer when someone asks us to perform the task, instead of getting the hammer ourselves, we get it from the person that wants us to do the task.\n\nWe can do the same when managing the dependencies in our systems.\nSimply put, instead of the class instantiating the dependency itself,\nthe class asks for the dependency (via constructor or a setter, for example).\nBut let's revisit how we applied this idea in the previous chapter.\nLet's assume that the InvoiceFilter was implemented as follows:\npublic class InvoiceFilter {\n\n  public void filter() {\n    IssuedInvoices dao = new IssuedInvoices();\n\n    // ...\n  }\n\n}\n\nIn our analogy, the InvoiceFilter (the worker) itself instantiates (searches for) the IssuedInvoices (hammer) class. \nWith an implementation like this, there is no easy way to pass any mocks to the InvoiceFilter.\nAny test code we devise will necessarily use a concrete instance of IssuedInvoices. As we know, IssuedInvoices goes to a database, which is something we have been trying to avoid.\nThus, we cannot control the way the IssuedInvoice operates, at least for testing purposes.\nThis makes it harder for developers to write automated tests.\nInstead, we can design our class in a way that it allows dependencies to be injected. Note how we receive the dependency via constructor now:\npublic class InvoiceFilter {\n\n  private final IssuedInvoices issuedInvoices;\n\n  public InvoiceFilter(IssuedInvoices issuedInvoices) {\n    this.issuedInvoices = issuedInvoices;\n  }\n\n  public void lowValuedInvoices() {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nIn this new implementation, we can now instantiate\nthe InvoiceFilter class and pass it a mocked/stubbed version of IssuedInvoices in the test code.\nThis simple change in the design of the class makes the creation of automated tests easier and, therefore, increases the testability of the code.\nNote that with such a design decision, the InvoiceFilter class also enables the production code to pass a concrete instance of\nIssueInvoices. After all, when the program is running \"for real\", we want the real implementation of IssuedInvoices to work.\nMore formally, Dependency injection is a technique where one object supplies the required dependencies of the another object. As in our example, whenever a client decides to make use of InvoiceFilter, it will have to also supply an IssuedInvoice. The term \"injection\" is about \"injecting\" a dependency, in this case the IssuedInvoice, to another class, in this case InvoiceFilter.\nThe use of dependency injection improves our code in many ways:\n\nIt enables us to mock/stub the dependencies in the test code, increasing the productivity of the developer during the testing phase.\nIt makes all the dependencies more explicit; after all, they all need to be injected (via constructor, for example).\nIt affords better separation of concerns: classes now do not need to worry about how to build their dependencies, as they are injected to them.\nThe class becomes more extensible. As a client of the class, you can pass any dependency via the constructor. Suppose a class depends on a type A (and receives it via constructor). As a client, you can pass A or any implementation of A, e.g., if A is List, you can pass ArrayList or LinkedList. Your class can now work with many different implementations of A.\n\nIf you want to understand more advanced OOP concepts, we suggest reading more about:\n\nThe Open-Closed Principle;\nInversion of Control;\nSeparation of concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain vs infrastructure\nA general recommendation to design for testability comes down to separating domain from infrastructure.\nThe domain is where the core of the system lies, i.e. where all the business rules, logics, entities, services, etc, reside.\nThroughout this book we have been using business systems as examples. Entities like Invoice, ChristmasDiscountCalculator\nare examples of domain classes.\nInfrastructure relates to all code that handles some infrastructure. For example, pieces of code that handle database queries, or webservice calls, or file reads and writes.\nIn our examples, all our Data Access Objects are part of what we call infrastructure code.\nWe observe that, when domain code and infrastructure code are mixed up together, the system becomes harder to test.\nLet us go back to our InvoiceFilter example with it now containing the SQL logic, instead of it depending on a Data Access Object:\npublic class InvoiceFilter {\n\n  // accessing the database\n  private List all() {\n    Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(\"db\", \"root\", \"\");\n\n    return withSql( () -> {\n        try (var ps = connection.prepareStatement(\"select * from invoice\")) {\n            final var rs = ps.executeQuery();\n\n            List allInvoices = new ArrayList<>();\n            while (rs.next()) {\n                allInvoices.add(new Invoice(rs.getString(\"name\"), rs.getInt(\"value\")));\n            }\n            return allInvoices;\n        }\n    });\n\n    connection.close();\n  }\n\n  public List lowValueInvoices() {\n\n    var issuedInvoices = all();\n\n    return issuedInvoices.all().stream()\n        .filter(invoice -> invoice.value \nWe can make the following observations about the code above:\n\nThe code is less cohesive. It knows how to extract data from the database and it also knows the \"low value invoices\" business rule. This class now requires test cases that cover both responsibilities.\nDomain code and infrastructure code are mixed up. This means a tester will not be able to avoid database access when\ntesting the \"low value invoices\" rule. As we have seen many times already, this will incur higher costs.\nThis new version of the InvoiceFilter class is definitely more complex than our previous version and complex code are more prone to defects.\n\nOur previous version was indeed better. It was more cohesive and simpler. More importantly it also had a clear separation between domain code and infrastructure code. This is what software developers should always do when they design systems in order to ensure these two responsibilities are separated from each other.\nThis idea of separating infrastructure and domain is explored in the following literature:\n\nIn the Ports and Adapters (also called the Hexagonal Architecture) idea, as proposed by Alistair Cockburn, the domain (business logic) depends on \"Ports\", rather than directly on the infrastructure.\nThese ports are interfaces that define what the infrastructure is able to do.\nThese ports are completely separated from the implementation of the infrastructure.\nThe \"adapters\", on the other hand, are very close to the infrastructure.\nThese are the implementations of the ports that talk to the database, webservice, etc.\nThey know how the infrastructure works and how to communicate with it.\n\nIn the schema below, you can see that the ports are part of the domain.\n\nPorts and Adapters help us a lot with the testability of our code.\nIf our core domain depends only on ports, we can easily stub/mock them.\n\nIn his Domain-Driven Design work, Eric Evans proposes that the domain (the core of the system) will be isolated from the infrastructure layer. Besides all the design benefits that Eric cites in his book, testers benefit from this separation, as it enables them to exercise parts of code without having to depend on heavy infrastructure.\n\nIn practice, we observe that separating the infrastructure from domain is often challenging. The database example, where we move all the code to another class, is rather a simplistic one. When building software, we frequently rely on different libraries and frameworks that are often opinionated and require you to follow certain design decisions that might not be ideal, from a testability perspective. It is the duty of a developer to be able to abstract these problems, making sure that the domain concerns are always separated from the infrastructure concerns.\nYou see developers vouching for domain objects not to depend on concrete implementations of the infrastructure code, but rather, to depend solely on abstractions. In our example, the InvoiceFilter domain object, instead of depending on a concrete implementation of IssuedInvoices (one that right now contains SQL code and knows how to communicate with the database), it would depend on an abstraction/interface.\nBy devising interfaces that represent the abstract interaction that domains and infrastructure classes will have with each other, the developer ends up separating the concerns in a better way, reducing the coupling between both layers, and devising simpler flows of interactions between both layers.\nThe dependency inversion principle (note the inversion and not injection) helps us to formalise these concepts:\n\nHigh-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g. interfaces).\nAbstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementation-level tips on designing for testability\nWe end this chapter with a couple of practical tips that will help you to devise testable systems/classes:\n\nCohesion and testability: cohesive classes are classes that do only one thing.\nCohesive classes tend to be easier to test. This is because fewer responsibilities imply fewer test cases and fewer responsibilities often imply fewer dependencies (as you need fewer to compose the required functionality) which in turn incurs lower testing costs.\n\nOn the other hand, a non-cohesive class tends to consume a large amount of testing effort from developers. You might notice that a non-cohesive class requires so many test cases, that you often feel like \"the testing is never-ending\".\nRefactoring non-cohesive classes is therefore an important task when it comes to testability. A common way to do this is by splitting the non-cohesive class into several smaller-but-cohesive classes. Each small class can then be tested separately, and the class that combines them  might rely either on mock objects to assert the correctness of the interactions among the dependencies or on an integration test (or both).\n\nCoupling and testability: Coupling refers to the number of classes that a class depends on. A highly coupled class requires several other\nclasses to do its work. Coupling decreases testability. A tester trying to test a highly dependent class ends up having to test all its dependencies together. If the tester then decides to use stubs/mocks, the costs of setting them up will also be higher than it needed to be (just imagine yourself setting up 10 or 15 stubs/mocks to test a single class). Moreover, the number of test cases that would be required to achieve a minimum amount of coverage is too high, as each dependency probably brings together a whole set of requirements and conditions.\n\nReducing coupling, however, is often tricky, and maybe one of the biggest challenges in software design.\nA common coupling-related refactoring is to group dependencies together into a higher and meaningful abstraction.\nImagine that class A depends on B, C, D and E. After inspection, you notice that B interacts with C, and D interacts with E.\nDevising a new class that handles the communication between B and C (let us call it BC), and other one that handles the communication between D and E (let us call it DE), already reduces A's coupling. After all, it now depends only on BC, and DE. In general, pushing responsibilities and dependencies to smaller classes and later connecting them via larger abstractions is the way to go.\n\nComplex conditions and testability: We have seen in previous chapters that conditions that are very complex (e.g., an if statement composed of multiple Boolean operations) require great effort from testers. For example, the number of tests one might devise after applying some boundary testing or condition+branch coverage criteria might be\ntoo high. \n\nReducing the complexity of such conditions, for example by breaking it into multiple smaller conditions, will not reduce the overall complexity of the problem, but will \"spread\" it.\n\nPrivate methods and testability: A common question among developers is whether to test private methods or not.\nIn principle, testers should test private methods only through their public methods. However, testers often feel the urge to test a particular private method in isolation. One common cause for this feeling is the lack of cohesion or the complexity of this private method. In other words, this method does something so different to the public method, and/or its task is so complex, that it has to be tested separately. This is a good example of when \"the test speaks to the developer\" (a common saying among Test-Driven Developers).\n\nIn terms of the design this might mean that this private method does not belong in its current place. A common refactoring is to extract this method, maybe to a new brand new class. There, the former private method, now a public method, can be tested normally by the developer. The original class, where the private method used to be, should now depend on this new class.\n\nStatic methods and testability: As we have seen before, static methods adversely affect testability, as they can not be stubbed easily. Therefore, a good rule of thumb is to avoid the creation of static methods whenever possible.\nExceptions to this rule are utility methods. As we saw before, utility methods are often not mocked.\n\nIf your system has to depend on a specific static method, e.g., because it comes with the framework your software depends on, adding an abstraction on top of it, similar to what we did with the Calendar class in the previous chapter, might be a good decision to facilitate testability.\nThe same recommendation applies when your system needs code from others or external dependencies.\nAgain, creating layers/classes that abstract away the dependency might help you in increasing testability.\nWe emphasise that developers should not be afraid to create these extra layers. While it might seem that these layers will increase the overall complexity of the design, the increased testability pays off.\nFinally, note how there is a deep synergy between well designed production code and testability.\nWe repeat that focusing only on testing techniques (like the ones we discussed in the Testing Techniques section of this book), or only on design techniques (like the ones we have been focusing on in this section of the book), is not enough. High-quality software is only achieved when software systems are designed with testability in mind, and rigorous testing techniques are applied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nHow can we improve the testability of the OrderDeliveryBatch class?\npublic class OrderDeliveryBatch {\n\n  public void runBatch() {\n\n    OrderDao dao = new OrderDao();\n    DeliveryStartProcess delivery = new DeliveryStartProcess();\n\n    List orders = dao.paidButNotDelivered();\n\n    for (Order order : orders) {\n      delivery.start(order);\n\n      if (order.isInternational()) {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"5 days from now\");\n      } else {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"2 days from now\");\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass OrderDao {\n  // accesses a database\n}\n\nclass DeliveryStartProcess {\n  // communicates with a third-party webservice\n}\n\nWhich techniques can we apply? What would the new implementation look like? Think about what you would need to include in order to test the OrderDeliveryBatch class.\nExercise 2.\nConsider the following requirement and implementation.\nA webshop gives a discount of 15% on King's Day.\n\npublic class KingsDayDiscount {\n\n  public double discount(double value) {\n\n    Calendar today = Calendar.getInstance();\n\n    boolean isKingsDay = today.get(MONTH) == Calendar.APRIL\n        && today.get(DAY_OF_MONTH) == 27;\n\n    return isKingsDay ? value * 0.15 : 0;\n\n  }\n}\n\nWe want to create a unit test for this class.\nWhy does this class have bad testability?\nWhat can we do to improve the testability?\nI.e. why is it difficult to test the method?\nExercise 3.\nSarah has joined a mobile app team that has been trying to write automated tests for a while.\nThe team wants to write unit tests for part of their code, but \"that's really hard\", according to the developers.\nAfter some code review, the developers themselves listed the following\nproblems in their codebase:\n\nMany classes mix infrastructure and business rules;\nThe database has large tables and no indexes;\nUse of static methods;\nSome classes have too many attributes/fields.\n\nTo increase the testability, the team has a budget to work on two out of the four issues above.\nWhich items should Sarah recommend them to tackle first?\nNote: All of the four issues should obviously be fixed.\nHowever, try to prioritise the two most important ones: which influence the testability the most?\nExercise 4.\nObservability and controllability are two important concepts when it comes to software testing.\nThree developers could benefit from improving either the observability or the controllability of the system/class which they are testing but each developer encounters a problem:\n\n\"I can't really assert that the method under test worked well.\"\n\"I need to make sure this class starts with that Boolean set to false, but I simply can't do it.\"\n\"I just instantiated the mock object, but there's no way to inject it in the class.\"\n\nState for each of the problems above whether it relates to observability or controllability.\nReferences\n\nCockburn, Alistair.

This is because, when focusing on making the test\npass, we might have ignored the quality of our production code.\nWe then repeat the process from the beginning. We stop once we are satisfied with our implementation and\nthe requirement is met.\nAdvantages of TDD\nTDD has several advantages:\n\nBy creating the test first, we also look at the requirements first.\nThis makes us write the code for the specific problem that it is supposed to solve.\nIn turn, this prevents us from writing unnecessary code.\n\nWe can control our pace of writing production code.\nOnce we have a failing test, our goal is clear: to make the test pass.\nWith the test that we create, we can control the pace we follow when writing the production code.\nIf we are confident about how to solve the problem, we can make a big step by creating a complicated test.\nHowever, if we are not sure how to tackle the problem, we can break it into smaller parts and start by creating tests for these and then proceed with the other parts.\n\nThe tests are derived from the requirements.\nTherefore, we know that, when the tests pass, the code does what it is supposed to do.\nIf we write tests using code that has already been written, the tests might pass but the code might not be doing the right thing.\nThe tests also show us how easy it is to use the class we just made.\nWe are using the class directly in the tests so we know immediately when we can improve something.\n\nTestable code from the beginning.\nCreating the tests first makes us think about the way to test the classes before implementing them. After all, we need testable classes from the beginning, if we start from the test code. Because TDD forces developers to change how they design their code, it improves the testability, and more specifically also the controllability of our code. We already talked about the importance of this aspect when creating automated tests. Controllable code will be easier to test, resulting in improved code quality. \n\nQuick feedback on the code that we are writing.\nInstead of writing a lot of code and then a lot of tests, i.e. getting a lot of feedback at once after a long period of time, we create a test and then write a small piece of code for that test.\nIt becomes easier to identify new problems as they arise, because they relate to the small amount of code that was added last.\nIn addition, if we want to change something, it will be easier to do on a relatively small amount of code.\n\nBaby steps: TDD encourages developers to work in small (baby) steps: first define the smallest possible functionality, then write the simplest code that makes the test green, and carry out one refactoring at a time.\n\nFeedback on design. The properties of the tests we write can indicate certain types of problems in the code.\nThis is why Test-Driven Development is sometimes called Test-Driven Design. We discussed design for testability in\na previous chapter. You might get information about the quality of your design by looking at the tests during the writing process.\nFor example, too many tests for just one class can indicate that the class has too many functionalities and that it should be split up into more classes.\nIf we need too many mocks inside of the tests, the class might be too coupled, i.e. it needs too many other classes to function.\nIf it is very complex to set everything up for the test, we may have to think about the pre-conditions that the class uses.\nMaybe there are too many pre-conditions or maybe some are not necessary.\nAll of this can be observed in the tests, while doing TDD.\nIt is good to think about design early on as it is easier to change the design of a class at the beginning of the development, rather than a few months later.\n\n\nShould I do TDD 100% of the time?\nGiven all these advantages, should we use TDD 100% of time?\nThere is, of course, no universal answer. While some research shows the advantages of TDD, others throw more doubt on it.\nOur pragmatic suggestion is:\n\nYou should use TDD when you do not know how to design and/or architect a part of the system. TDD might help you to explore\ndifferent design decisions.\n\nYou should use TDD when you are dealing with a complex problem, a problem in which you lack experience. If you are facing a\nnew challenging implementation, TDD might help you in taking a step back and learn on the way. The use of baby steps might\nhelp you to start slowly, to learn more about the requirement, and to get up to speed once you are more familiar with the problem.\n\nYou should not use TDD when you are familiar with the problem, or the design decisions are clear in your mind.\nIf there is \"nothing to be learned or explored\", TDD might not really afford any significant benefit. However, we note that, even if you\nare not doing TDD, you should write tests in a timely manner. Do not leave it for the end of the day or the end of a sprint.\nWrite them together with the production code, so that the growing automated test suite will give you more and more confidence \nabout the code.\n\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nWe have the following skeleton for a diagram illustrating the Test Driven Development cycle.\nWhat words/sentences should be at the numbers?\n\n(Try to answer the question without scrolling up!)\nExercise 2.\nRemember the RomanNumeral problem?\n\nThe Roman Numeral problem\nIt is our goal to implement a program that receives a string \nas a parameter containing a roman number and then \nconverts it to an integer.\nIn roman numeral, letters represent values:\n\nI = 1\nV = 5\nX = 10\nL = 50\nC = 100\nD = 500\nM = 1000\n\nLetters can be combined to form numbers.\nFor example we make 6 by using 5+1=65 + 1 = 65+1=6 and \nhave the roman number \"VI\".\nExample: 7 is \"VII\", 11 is \"XI\" and 101 is \"CI\".\nSome numbers need to make use of a subtractive notation \nto be represented.\nFor example we make 40 not by \"XXXX\", but \ninstead we use 50−10=4050 - 10 = 4050−10=40 and have the roman number \"XL\".\nOther examples: 9 is \"XI\", 40 is \"XL\", 14 is \"XIV\".\nThe letters should be ordered from the highest to the lowest value.\nThe values of each individual letter is added together.\nUnless the subtractive notation is used in which a letter \nwith a lower value is placed in front of a letter with a higher value.\nCombining both these principles we could give our \nmethod \"MDCCCXLII\" and it should return 1842.\n\nImplement this program. Practise TDD!\nExercise 3.\nWhich of the following is the least important reason to do Test-Driven Development?\n\nAs a consequence of the practice of TDD, software systems get tested completely.\nTDD practitioners use the feedback from the test code as a design hint.\nThe practice of TDD enables developers to have steady, incremental progress throughout the development of a feature.\nThe use of mock objects helps developers to understand the relationships between objects.\n\nExercise 4.\nTDD has become a really popular practice among developers. According to them, TDD has several benefits. Which of the following statements \nis not considered a benefit which results from the practice of TDD?\nNote: We are looking from the perspective of developers, which may not always match the results of empirical research.\n\nBetter team integration. Writing tests is a social activity and makes the team more aware of their code quality. \n\nBaby steps. Developers can take smaller steps whenever they feel this is necessary.\n\nRefactoring. The cycle prompts developers to improve their code constantly.\n\nDesign for testability. Developers are \"forced\" to write testable code from the beginning.\n\n\nReferences\n\nBeck, K. (2003).

In practice,\ntest code bases tend to grow very fast. Empirically, we have been observing\nthat Lehman's laws of evolution also apply to test code: code tends to rot, unless\none actively works against it. Thus,\nas with production code, developers have to put extra effort \nin making high-quality test code bases, so that it can be maintained and evolved in a\nsustainable way.\nIn this chapter, we go over some best practices \nin test code engineering. More specifically:\n\nA set of principles that should guide developers when writing test code.\nFor those, we discuss both the FIRST principles (from the Pragmatic Unit Testing book),\nas well as the recent Test Desiderata (proposed by Kent Beck)\nA set of well-known test smells that might emerge in test code.\nSome tips on how to make tests more readable.\nWhat flaky tests are and their possible causes.\n\nThe FIRST principles\nIn the Pragmatic Unit Testing book, the authors discuss the \"FIRST Properties of Good Tests\".\nFIRST is an acronym for fast, isolated, repeatable, self-validating, and timely:\n\nFast: \nTests are the safety net of a developer. Whenever developers perform any maintenance\nor evolution in the source code, they use the feedback of the test suite to understand\nwhether the system is still working as expected. \nThe faster the feedback a developer gets from their test code, the better.\nOn the other hand, slower test suites force developers to simply run the tests less often,\nmaking them less effective. Therefore, good tests are fast.\nThere is no hard line that separates slow from fast tests. Good sense is fundamental.\nOnce you are facing a slow test, you might consider:\nMaking use of mocks/stubs to replace slower components that are part of the test\nRe-designing the production code so that slower pieces of code can be tested separately from fast pieces of code\nMoving slower tests to a different test suite, one that developers might run less often. \nIt is not uncommon to see developers having sets of unit tests that run fast, and these they run all day long, and sets of slower integration and system tests that run once or twice a day in the Continuous Integration server. \n\n\n\n\nIsolated: Tests should be as cohesive, as independent, and as isolated as possible. \nIdeally, a single test method should test just a single functionality or behaviour of the system.\nHaving fat tests (or, as the test smells community calls it, eager tests) that test\nmultiple functionalities are often complex in terms of implementation. Complex test code reduces\nthe ability of developers to understand what it tests in a glance, and makes future maintenance\nharder. If you are facing such a test, break it into multiple smaller tests. Simpler and shorter\ncode is always better.\n  Moreover, tests should not depend on other tests to run. The result of a test should be the\n  same, whether the test is executed in isolation or together with the rest of the test suite.\n  It is not uncommon to see cases where some test B only works if test A is executed before it.\n  This is often the case when test B relies on the work of test A to set up the environment\n  for it. Such tests become highly unreliable, as they might fail just because the\n  developer forgot about such a detail. In such cases, refactor the test code so that the tests\n  are responsible for setting up all the environment they need. If tests A and B depend on\n  similar resources, make sure they can share the same code, so that you avoid duplicating\n  code. JUnit's @BeforeEach or @BeforeAll methods can become handy. Moreover, make sure\n  that your tests \"clean up their messes\", e.g., by deleting any possible files it created\n  on the disk, or cleaning up values it inserted in a database.\n\n\n\nRepeatable: A repeatable test is a test that gives the same result, no matter how many times it is executed.\nDevelopers tend to lose their trust in tests that present a flaky behaviour (i.e., it sometimes passes, and sometimes fails without any changes in the system and/or in the test code).\nFlaky tests might happen for different reasons, and some of the causes can be tricky\nto identify (companies have reported extreme examples where a test presented a flaky behaviour\nonly once in a month). Common causes are dependencies on external resources, not waiting long\nenough for an external resource to finish its task, and concurrency.\n\n\nSelf-validating: \nThe tests should validate/assert the result themselves. This might seem an unnecessary\nprinciple to mention. However, it is not uncommon for developers to make mistakes and to not write\nassertions in the test, causing the test to always pass. In other more complex cases,\nwriting the assertions or, in other words, verifying the expected behaviour, might not be possible.\nIn cases where observing the outcome of a behaviour is not easily achievable, we suggest\nthe developer to refactor the class or method under test to increase its observability (revisit\nour chapter on design for testability).\n\n\nTimely: \nDevelopers should be test infected. They should write and run tests as often\nas possible. While less technical than the other principles in this list, changing\nthe behaviour of development teams towards writing automated test code can still be challenging.\n  Leaving the test phase to the very end of the development process, as commonly done\n  in the past, might incur in\n  unnecessary costs. After all, at that point, the system might be simply hard to test.\n  Moreover, as we have seen, tests serve as a safety net to developers. Developing large\n  complex systems without such a net is highly unproductive and prone to fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Desiderata\nKent Beck, the \"creator\" of Test-Driven Development (and author of the \n\"Test-Driven Development: By Example\" book), recently wrote a list of eleven\nproperties that good tests have (the test desiderata). \nThe following list comes directly from his blog post. Note how some of these principles\nare also part of the FIRST principles.\n\nIsolated: tests should return the same results regardless of the order in which they are run.\nComposable: if tests are isolated, then I can run 1 or 10 or 100 or 1,000,000 and get the same results.\nFast: tests should run quickly.\nInspiring: passing the tests should inspire confidence\nWritable: tests should be cheap to write relative to the cost of the code being tested.\nReadable: tests should be comprehensible for their readers, invoking the motivation for writing this particular test.\nBehavioural: tests should be sensitive to changes in the behaviour of the code under test. If the behaviour changes, the test result should change.\nStructure-insensitive: tests should not change their result if the structure of the code changes.\nAutomated: tests should run without human intervention.\nSpecific: if a test fails, the cause of the failure should be obvious.\nDeterministic: if nothing changes, the test result should not change.\nPredictive: if the tests all pass, then the code under test should be suitable for production.\n\nTest code smells\nNow that we covered some best practices, let us look at the other\nside of the coin: test code smells.\nThe term code smell is a well-known term that indicates possible symptoms that might\nindicate deeper problems in the source code of the system. \nSome very well-known examples are Long Method, Long Class, or God Class.\nA good number of research papers show us that code smells hinder the comprehensibility and the maintainability of software systems.\nWhile the term has been long applied to production code, given\nthe rise of test code, our community has been developing catalogues of smells that\nare now specific to test code.\nResearch has also shown that test smells are prevalent in real life and, unsurprisingly, often negatively impact the maintenance and comprehensibility of the test suite.\nIn the following, we will discuss several of the well-known test smells. A more comprehensive\nlist can be found in the xUnit Test Patterns book, by Meszaros.\nCode Duplication: \nIt is not surprising that code duplication might also happen in test code, \nas it is very common in production code.\nTests are often similar in structure. You might have noticed it in several of the code\nexamples throughout this book. We even made use of JUnit's Parameterised Tests feature\nto reduce some of the duplication.\nA less attentive developer might end up writing duplicated code \n(copying and pasting often happens in real life) instead of putting\nsome effort in implementing a better solution. \nDuplicated code might reduce the productivity of software testers.\nAfter all, if there is a need for a change in a duplicated piece of code, a developer\nwill have to apply the same change over and over again, at all places where the code was duplicated. \nIn practice, it is easy to skip one of these places, ending up with \nproblematic test code.\nNote that the effects are similar to the effects of code duplication in production code.\nWe suggest developers to ruthlessly refactor their test code. The extraction of a duplicated piece of\ncode to private methods or external classes is often a good solution for the problem.\nAssertion Roulette:\nAssertions are the first thing a developer looks at when a test is failing.\nAssertions, thus, have to clearly communicate what is going wrong with the component\nunder test. \nThe test smell emerges when it is hard to understand the \nassertions themselves, or why they are failing.\nThere are several reasons for this smell to happen. Some features or business rules\nare simply too complex and require a complex set of assertions to ensure their behaviour.\nSuddenly, developers end up writing complex assert instructions that are not easy to\nunderstand. In such cases, we recommend developers to 1) write their own customised\nassert instructions that abstract away part of the complexity of the assertion code itself,\n2) when expressing it in code is not enough, write code comments that quickly explain, in natural language, what those assertions are about.\nInterestingly, a common best practice that is often found in the test best practice literature is the \"one assertion per method\" strategy. While forcing developers to have just a single assertion per test method is too extremist, the idea of minimising the number of assertions in a test method is valid.\nNote that a high number of simple assertions in a single test might be as harmful as a complex\nset of assertions. In such cases, we provide a similar recommendation: write a customised\nassertion instruction to abstract away the need for long sequences of assertions.\nEmpirically, we also observe that the number of assertions in a test is often large, because\ndevelopers tend to write more than one test case in a single test method. We also have done\nthat in this book (see the boundary testing chapter, where we test both sides of the boundary\nin a single test method). However, parsimony is fundamental. Splitting up a large test method\nthat contains multiple test cases might reduce the cognitive load required by the developer\nto understand it.\nResource Optimism:\nResource optimism happens when a test assumes that a necessary resource (e.g., a database) is readily available at the start of its execution. This is related to the isolated principle\nof the FIRST principles and of Beck's test desiderata.\nTo avoid resource optimism, a test should not assume that the resource is already in the correct state. The test should be the one responsible for setting up the state itself. This might mean that\nthe test is the one responsible for populating a database, for writing the required files in the disk, or for starting up a Tomcat server. (This set up might require complex code, and developers\nshould also do their best effort in abstracting way such complexity by, e.g., moving such \ncode to other classes, e.g., DatabaseInitialization or TomcatLoader, allowing the\ntest code to focus on the test cases themselves).\nSimilarly, another incarnation of the resource optimism smell happens\nwhen the test assumes that the resource is available all the time.\nSuppose a test method that interacts with a webservice.\nThe webservice might be down for reasons we do not control.\nTo avoid this test smell, developers have two options:\nFirst, to avoid using external resources, by using stubs and mocks.\nHowever, if the test cannot avoid using the external dependency, make it robust enough.\nIn that case, make your test suite skip that test when the resource is unavailable, and provide a message explaining why that was the case. This seems counterintuitive, but again, remember\nthat developers trust their test suites. Having a single test failing for the wrong reasons\nmakes developers lose their confidence in the entire test suite.\nIn addition to changing your tests, developers must make sure \nthat the environments, where the tests are executed, have the required resources available.\nContinuous integration tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, and Travis can help developers in \nmaking sure that tests are being run in the correct environment.\nTest Run War:\nThe war is an analogy for when two tests are \"fighting\" for the same resources.\nOne can observe a test run war when tests start to fail as soon as more than one developer\nrun their test suites.\nImagine a test suite that uses a centralised database. When developer A runs the test, the test changes the state of the database. At the same time, \ndeveloper B runs the same test, which also goes to the same database. \nThus, both tests are touching the same database at the same time. \nThis unexpected situation might cause the test to fail.\nIsolation is key to avoid this test smell. In the example of a centralised database,\none solution would be to make sure each developer has its own instance of a database. That would\navoid the fight for the same resource. (Related to this example, we discuss more about \ndatabase testing in a specific chapter).\nGeneral Fixture:\nA fixture is the set of input values that will be used to exercise the component under test.\nWe have called fixture the arrange part of the test before.\nAs you might have noticed, fixtures are the \"stars\" of the test method, as they derive\nnaturally from the test cases we devised using any of the techniques we have discussed. \nWhen testing more complex components, developers might need to make use of several\ndifferent fixtures; one for each partition they want to exercise. These fixtures might\nthen become complex. And worst: while tests are different from each other, their fixtures\nmight have some intersection. \nGiven this possible intersection among the different fixtures, as well as the difficulty\nthat it is to keep building these complex entities and fixtures, a less attentive developer\nmight decide to declare a \"large\" fixture that works for many different tests. Each test\nwould then use a small part of this large fixture. \nWhile this approach might work and tests might correctly implement the test cases,\nthey will be hard to maintain. Once a test fails, developers with the mission\nof understanding the cause of the failure, will face a large fixture that is not totally\nrelevant for/of interest to them. In practice, the developer would have to manually\n\"filter out\" part of the fixture that are not really exercised by the failing test.\nThat is an unnecessary cost.\nMaking sure that the fixture of a test is as specific and cohesive as possible helps\ndevelopers in comprehending the essence of a test (which is often highly relevant when\nthe test starts fail).\nBuild patterns, with the focus of building test data, \nmight help developers in avoiding such a smell. More specifically, \nthe Test Data Builder is\nan often used design pattern in test code of enterprise applications (we give an example\nof a Test Data Builder later in this chapter). Such applications\noften have to deal with the creation of complex sets of interrelated \nbusiness entities, which can easily\nlead developers to write general fixtures.\nIndirect tests and eager tests:\nTests should be as cohesive and as focused as possible. A testing class ATest that aims at testing\nsome class A should solely focus on testing this class A. Even if it depends on a class\nB, requiring ATest to instantiate B, ATest should focus on exercising A and A only.\nThe smell, however, emerges when a test class focuses its efforts on testing many classes\nat once. \nLess cohesive tests harm productivity. How do developers know where tests for a given B class\nare? If test classes focus on more than a single class, tests for B might be anywhere.\nDevelopers would have to look for them. \nIt is also expected that, without proper care, tests for a single class would live in\nmany other test classes, e.g., tests for B might exist in ATest, BTest, CTest, etc.\nTests, and more specifically, unit test classes and methods, should have a clear focus.\nThey should test a single unit. If they have to depend on other classes, the use of\nmocks and stubs might help the developer in isolating that test and avoid indirect\ntesting. If the use of mocks and stubs is not possible, make sure that assertions\nfocus on the real class under test, and that failures caused by dependencies (and not \nby the class under test) are clearly indicated in the outcome of the test method.\nSimilar to what we have discussed when talking about the excessive number of assertions\nin a single test, avoiding eager tests, or tests that exercise more than a unique\nbehaviour of the component is also a best practice. Test methods that exercise multiple\nbehaviours at once tend to be overly long and complex, making it harder for developers\nto comprehend them in a quick glance.\nSensitive Equality:\nGood assertions are fundamental in test cases. A bad assertion might lead a test\nto not fail when it should. However, a bad assertion might also lead a test to fail\nwhen it should not.\nEngineering a good assertion statement is challenging. Even more so when components\nproduce fragile outputs, i.e., outputs that tend to change often. \nTest code should be as resilient as possible to the implementation details\nof the component under test. Assertions should also be not too sensitive to internal\nchanges. \nImagine a class Item that represents an item of a cart shop. \nAn item is composed of a name, a quantity, and an individual price. The final price\nof the item is the multiplication of its quantity per its individual price.\nThe class has the following implementation:\nimport java.math.BigDecimal;\n\npublic class Item {\n\n    private final String name;\n    private final int qty;\n    private final BigDecimal individualPrice;\n\n    public Item(String name, int qty, BigDecimal individualPrice) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.qty = qty;\n        this.individualPrice = individualPrice;\n    }\n\n    // getters ...\n\n    public BigDecimal finalAmount() {\n        return individualPrice.multiply(new BigDecimal(qty));\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Product \" + name + \" times\" + qty + \" = \" + finalAmount();\n    }\n}\n\nSuppose now that a less attentive developer writes the following test as to exercise\nthe finalAmount behaviour:\npublic class ItemTest {\n\n    @Test\n    void qtyTimesIndividualPrice() {\n        var item = new Item(\"Playstation IV with 64 GB and super wi-fi\",\n                3,\n                new BigDecimal(\"599.99\"));\n\n        // this is too sensitive!\n        Assertions.assertEquals(\"Product Playstation IV with 64 GB \" +\n                \"and super wi-fi times \" + 3 + \" = 1799.97\", item.toString());\n    }\n}\n\nThe test above indeed exercises the calculation of the final amount. However,\none can see that the developer took a shortcut. (S)he decided to assert the overall\nbehaviour by making use of the toString method of the class. Maybe because\nthe developer felt that this assertion was more strict, as it asserts not only\nthe final price, but also the name of the product and its quantity. \nWhile this seems to work at first,\nthis assertion is sensitive to changes in the implementation of the toString. \nClearly,\nthe tester does not want its test to break if the toString changes, but only if the\nfinalAmount method changes. That is not what happens. Suppose that another developer\ndecided to shorten the length of the outcome of the toString:\n@Override\npublic String toString() {\n    return \"Product \" + name.substring(0, Math.min(11, name.length())) + \n      \" times \" + qty + \" = \" + finalAmount();\n}\n\nSuddenly, our qtyTimesIndividualPrice test fails:\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: \nExpected :Product Playstation IV with 64 GB and super wi-fi times 3 = 1799.97\nActual   :Product Playstatio times 3 = 1799.97\nA better assertion for this would be to assert precisely what is wanted from that behaviour.\nIn this case, assert that the final amount of the item is correctly calculated. A better\nimplementation for the test would be:\n@Test\nvoid qtyTimesIndividualPrice_lessSensitiveAssertion() {\n    var item = new Item(\"Playstation IV with 64 GB and super wi-fi\",\n            3,\n            new BigDecimal(\"599.99\"));\n\n    Assertions.assertEquals(new BigDecimal(\"1799.97\"), item.finalAmount());\n}\n\nRemember our discussion regarding design for testability. It might be better to \ncreate a method with a sole purpose of facilitating the test (or, in this case, the assertion)\nrather than having to rely on sensitive assertions that will possibly break the test\nfor the wrong reason in the future.\nInappropriate assertions: Somewhat related to the\nprevious smell, having the proper assertions makes a huge\ndifference between a good and a bad test case. While we have discussed how to derive\ngood test cases (and thus, good assertions), choosing the right implementation strategy\nfor writing the assertion can impact the maintenance of the test in the long run.\nThe wrong choice of an assertion instruction might give developers less information\nabout the failure, making the debugging process more difficult.\nImagine a very simplistic implementation of a Cart that receives products\nto be inserted into it. Products can not be repeated. A simple implementation might be:\npublic class Cart {\n    private final Set items = new HashSet<>();\n\n    public void add(String product) {\n        items.add(product);\n    }\n\n    public int numberOfItems() {\n        return items.size();\n    }\n}\n\nNow, a developer decided to test the numberOfItems behaviour. (S)he then wrote the following\ntest cases:\npublic class CartTest {\n    private final Cart cart = new Cart();\n\n    @Test\n    void numberOfItems() {\n        cart.add(\"Playstation\");\n        cart.add(\"Big TV\");\n\n        assertTrue(cart.numberOfItems() == 2);\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    void ignoreDuplicatedEntries() {\n        cart.add(\"Playstation\");\n        cart.add(\"Big TV\");\n        cart.add(\"Playstation\");\n\n        assertTrue(cart.numberOfItems() == 2);\n    }\n}\n\nNote that the less attentive developer opted for an assertTrue. While the test\nworks as expected, if it ever fails (which we can easily force by replacing the Set for a List\nin the Cart implementation), the assertion error message will be like\nas follows:\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: \nExpected : \nActual   :\nThe error message does not explicitly show the difference in the values. In this\nsimple example, it might seem that it is not too important, but take this to more \ncomplicated test cases. In the real world, a developer would have to add some debugging\ncode (System.out.printlns) to print the actual value that was produced by the method.\nThe test could help the developer by giving as much information as possible. To that aim,\nchoosing the right assertions is important, as they tend to give more information. \nIn this case, the use of an assertEquals is a better fit:\n@Test\nvoid numberOfItems() {\n    cart.add(\"Playstation\");\n    cart.add(\"Big TV\");\n\n    // assertTrue(cart.numberOfItems() == 2);\n    assertEquals(2, cart.numberOfItems());\n}\n\nLibraries such as AssertJ, besides making the assertions more legible, also\nhelp us in providing better error messages. Suppose our Cart class now has a \nallItems() method that returns all items that were previously stored in this cart:\npublic Set allItems() {\n    return Collections.unmodifiableSet(items);\n}\n\nAsserting the outcome of this method using plain old JUnit assertions would look\nlike the following:\n@Test\nvoid allItems() {\n    cart.add(\"Playstation\");\n    cart.add(\"Big TV\");\n\n    var items = cart.allItems();\n\n    assertTrue(items.contains(\"Playstation\"));\n    assertTrue(items.contains(\"Big TV\"));\n}\n\nAssertJ enables us to assert not only the items, but also the structure of the set itself.\nFor example, by making sure it only contains these two items, in a single assertion (note\nthe containsExactlyInAnyOrder() that does exactly what its name says):\n@Test\nvoid allItems() {\n    cart.add(\"Playstation\");\n    cart.add(\"Big TV\");\n\n    var items = cart.allItems();\n\n    assertThat(items).containsExactlyInAnyOrder(\"Playstation\", \"Big TV\");\n}\n\nThus, we recommend developers to choose wisely how to write the assertion statements.\nA good assertion clearly reveals its reason for failing, is legible, and is as specific\nand less sensitive as possible.\nMystery Guest: (Integration) tests often rely on external \ndependencies. They might be databases, files in the disk, or webservices (the \"guest\"). \nWhile such dependencies are unavoidable in these types of tests, making them clearly explicit\nin the test code might help developers in cases where these tests suddenly start to fail.\nA test that makes use of a guest, but hides it from the developer (making it \na \"mystery guest\") is simply harder to comprehend.\nMake sure your test gives proper error messages, differentiating between a fail in the\nexpected behaviour, or a fail due to a problem in the guest. Having assertions dedicated\nto ensure that the guest is in the right state before running the tests is often\nthe remedy that is applied to this smell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest code readability\nWe have discussed several test code best practices and smells. In many situations,\nwe have argued for the need of comprehensible, i.e., easy to read, test code.\nWe reinforce the fact that it \nis crucial that the developers can understand the test code easily.\nWe need readable and understandable test code. \nNote that \"readability\" is one of the test desiderata we mentioned above.\nIn the following, we present some of our personal tips on how to write readable test code.\nThe first tip concerns the structure of your tests.\nAs you have seen earlier, tests all follow the same structure: the Arrange, Act and Assert\nstructure.\nWhen these three parts are clearly separated, it is easier for a developer to see what is happening in the test.\nYour tests should make sure that a developer can quickly glance and identify these \nthree different parts. Where is the fixture? Where is the behaviour/method under test? \nWhere are the assertions?\nA second tip concerns the comprehensibility of the information in a test code.\nTest code is full of information, i.e., the input values that will be provided\nto the class under test, how the information flows up to the method under test, \nhow the output comes back from the exercise behaviour, and what the expected outcomes are.\nHowever, we often have to deal with complex data structures and information, making \nthe test code naturally complex.\nTo that aim, we should make sure that the (meaning of the) \nimportant information present in a test is easy to understand.\nGiving descriptive names to the information in the test code is a good remedy.\nLet us illustrate it in the example below.\nSuppose we have written a test for an Invoice class, that calculates the tax relative\nto that invoice.\npublic class Invoice {\n\n    private final BigDecimal value;\n    private final String country;\n    private final CustomerType customerType;\n\n    public Invoice(BigDecimal value, String country, CustomerType customerType) {\n        this.value = value;\n        this.country = country;\n        this.customerType = customerType;\n    }\n\n    public BigDecimal calculate() {\n        double ratio = 0.1;\n\n        // some business rule here to calculate the ratio\n        // depending on the value, company/person, country ...\n\n        return value.multiply(new BigDecimal(ratio));\n    }\n}\n\nA not-so-clear test code for the calculate() method could be:\n@Test\nvoid test1() {\n    var invoice = new Invoice(new BigDecimal(\"2500\"), \"NL\", CustomerType.COMPANY);\n    var v = invoice.calculate();\n    assertEquals(250, v.doubleValue(), 0.0001);\n}\n\nNote how, at first glance, it might hard to understand what all the information that is\npresent in the code means. It might be require some extra effort to understand what\nthis invoice looks like. Imagine now a real entity from a real enterprise system: an Invoice\nclass might have dozens of attributes. The name of the test as well as the name of\nthe cryptic variable v do not clearly explain what they mean. For developers less fluent\nin JUnit, it might also be hard to understand what the 0.0001 means (it represents a delta;\ndouble numbers in Java might have problems with rounding, so the assertion makes sure that both numbers are equal, within a plus or minus delta value).\nA better version for this test method could be:\n@Test\nvoid taxesForCompanies() {\n    var invoice = new InvoiceBuilder()\n            .asCompany()\n            .withCountry(\"NL\")\n            .withAValueOf(\"2500\")\n            .build();\n\n    var calculatedValue = invoice.calculate();\n\n    assertThat(calculatedValue).isCloseTo(new BigDecimal(\"250\"), within(new BigDecimal(\"0.001\")));\n}\n\nNote how our InvoiceBuilder (which we show the implementation soon) clearly expresses what\nthis invoice is about: it is an invoice for a company (as clearly stated by the asCompany() \nmethod), \"NL\" is the country of that invoice, and the invoice has a value of 2500. The\nresult of the behaviour now goes to a variable whose name says it all (calculatedValue). \nThe assertion then explicitly mentions that, given this is a float number, the best we can do\nis to compare whether they are close enough.\nThe InvoiceBuilder is an example of an implementation of a Test Data Builder, the design\npattern we mentioned before. The builder helps developers in creating fixtures, by providing\nthem with a clear and expressive API. The use of fluent interface (e.g., asCompany().withAValueOf()...) is also a common implementation choice, as it enables\ndevelopers to simply type less. In terms of coding, the InvoiceBuilder is simply\na Java class. The trick that allows methods to be chained is to return the class itself\nin the methods (note that methods return this).\npublic class InvoiceBuilder {\n\n    private String country = \"NL\";\n    private CustomerType customerType = CustomerType.PERSON;\n    private BigDecimal value = new BigDecimal(\"500.0\");\n\n    public InvoiceBuilder withCountry(String country) {\n        this.country = country;\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    public InvoiceBuilder asCompany() {\n        this.customerType = CustomerType.COMPANY;\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    public InvoiceBuilder withAValueOf(String value) {\n        this.value = new BigDecimal(value);\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    public Invoice build() {\n        return new Invoice(value, country, customerType);\n    }\n}\n\nDevelopers should feel free to customise their builders as much as they want. A common\ntrick is to make the builder to build a \"common\" version of the class, without requiring\nthe call of all the setup methods. This way, a developer can do:\nvar invoice = new InvoiceBuilder().build();\n\nIn such case, the build method, without any setup, will always build an invoice\nfor a person, with a value of 500.0, and having NL as country (see the initialised\nvalues in the InvoiceBuilder). \nOther developers might even give the build several shortcut methods that build other\n\"common\" fixtures for the class. For example, the following methods could very much \nexist in the Builder.\nThe anyCompany() method simply returns an Invoice that belongs to a company (and the\ndefault value for the other fields). The anyUS builds an Invoice for someone in the US:\npublic Invoice anyCompany() {\n    return new Invoice(value, country, CustomerType.COMPANY);\n}\n\npublic Invoice anyUS() {\n    return new Invoice(value, \"US\", customerType);\n}\n\nNote how test data builders might help developers in avoiding general fixtures.\nGiven that the builder makes it easier to build complex objects, developers might not\nfeel the need to rely so much on a general fixture.\nIntroducing test data builders, making good use of variable names to explain the meaning\nof the information, having clear assertions, and (although not exemplified here) having\ncomments in cases where code is not expressive enough will help developers in better\ncomprehending test code.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlaky tests\nFlaky tests (or erratic tests, as Mezsaros calls them in his book)\nare tests that present a \"flaky\" behaviour: \nthey sometimes pass and sometimes fail, even though\ndevelopers have not performed any changes in their software systems.\nSuch tests negatively impact the productivity of software development teams.\nFirst, it is hard to know whether a flaky test is failing because the behaviour\nis buggy, or because it is simply flaky. From the social side, the excessive\npresence of flaky tests make developers lose their confidence in their test\nsuites, little by little. The lack of confidence might lead them to deploy their\nsystems even though the tests are red (after all, they might be broken just because\nof flakiness, and not because the system is misbehaving).\nThe prevalence, and thus, the impact of flaky tests in the software development\nworld has been increasing over time. Companies like Google and Facebook as well\nas software engineering researchers have been\nextensively working towards automated ways of detecting and fixing flaky tests.\nFlaky tests can have a lot of causes.\nWe will name a few reasons:\n\nA test can be flaky because it depends on external and/or shared resources.\nLet us say we need a database to run our tests.\nSometimes the test passes, because the database is available; sometimes it fails, because the database is not available. Sometimes the test passes because the database is clean and\nready for that test; sometimes the test fails because the same test was being run by\nthe next developer and the database was not in a clean state.\n\nThe tests can be flaky due to improper time-outs.\nThis is a common cause in web testing.\nSuppose a test has to wait for something to happen in the system, e.g., a request\ncoming back from a webservice, which is then displayed in some HTML element.\nIf the web application is a bit slower than normal, the test might suddenly fail, just\nbecause \"it did not wait enough\".\n\nTests can be flaky due to a possible hidden interaction between different\ntest methods.\nSuppose that test A somehow influences the result of test B, \npossibly causing it to fail.\n\n\nAs you might have noticed, some of these causes \ncorrespond to scenarios we described when discussing the test smells.\nThe quality of our test code is thus very important.\nIf you want to find the exact cause of a flaky test, \nthe author of the XUnit Test Patterns book has made a whole decision table.\nYou can find it in the book or on Gerard Meszaros' website here.\nWith the decision table you can find a probable cause for the flakiness of your test.\nWe list several interesting research papers on flaky tests, their impact on software testing, and current state-of-the-art detection tools in our references section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises\nExercise 1.\nJeanette just heard that two tests are behaving strangely: when executed in isolation, both of them pass. However, when executed together, they fail. Which one of the following is not cause for this?\n\nBoth tests are very slow.\nThey depend upon the same external resources.\nThe execution order of the tests matter.\nThey do not perform a clean-up operation after execution.\n\nExercise 2.\nRepoDriller is a project that extracts information from Git repositories. Its integration tests consumes lots of real Git repositories, each one with a different characteristic, e.g., one repository contains a merge commit, another repository contains a revert operation, etc.\nIts tests look like what you see below:\n@Test\npublic void test01() {\n\n  // arrange: specific repo\n  String path = \"test-repos/git-4\";\n\n  // act\n  TestVisitor visitor = new TestVisitor();\n  new RepositoryMining()\n  .in(GitRepository.singleProject(path))\n  .through(Commits.all())\n  .process(visitor)\n  .mine();\n\n  // assert\n  Assert.assertEquals(3, visitor.getVisitedHashes().size());\n  Assert.assertTrue(visitor.getVisitedHashes().get(2).equals(\"b8c2\"));\n  Assert.assertTrue(visitor.getVisitedHashes().get(1).equals(\"375d\"));\n  Assert.assertTrue(visitor.getVisitedHashes().get(0).equals(\"a1b6\"));\n}\n\nWhich test smell does this piece of code suffer from?\n\nMystery guest\nCondition logic in test\nGeneral fixture\nFlaky test\n\nExercise 3.\nIn the code below, we present the source code of an automated test.\n@Test\npublic void flightMileage() {\n  // setup fixture\n  // exercise contructor\n  Flight newFlight = new Flight(validFlightNumber);\n  // verify constructed object\n  assertEquals(validFlightNumber, newFlight.number);\n  assertEquals(\"\", newFlight.airlineCode);\n  assertNull(newFlight.airline);\n  // setup mileage\n  newFlight.setMileage(1122);\n  // exercise mileage translater\n  int actualKilometres = newFlight.getMileageAsKm();    \n  // verify results\n  int expectedKilometres = 1810;\n  assertEquals(expectedKilometres, actualKilometres);\n  // now try it with a canceled flight\n  newFlight.cancel();\n  boolean flightCanceledStatus = newFlight.isCancelled();\n  assertFalse(flightCanceledStatus);\n}\n\nHowever, Joe, our new test specialist, believes this test is smelly and that it can be better written.\nWhich of the following could be Joe's main concern?\n\nThe test contains code that may or may not be executed, making the test less readable.\nIt is hard to tell which of several assertions within the same test method will cause a test failure.\nThe test depends on external resources and has nondeterministic results depending on when/where it is run.\nThe test reader is not able to see the cause and effect between fixture and verification logic because part of it is done outside the test method.\n\nExercise 4.\nSee the test code below. What is the most likely test code smell that this piece of code presents?\n@Test\nvoid test1() {\n  // webservice that communicates with the bank\n  BankWebService bank = new BankWebService();\n\n  User user = new User(\"d.bergkamp\", \"nl123\");\n  bank.authenticate(user);\n  Thread.sleep(5000); // sleep for 5 seconds\n\n  double balance = bank.getBalance();\n  Thread.sleep(2000);\n\n  Payment bill = new Payment();\n  bill.setOrigin(user);\n  bill.setValue(150.0);\n  bill.setDescription(\"Energy bill\");\n  bill.setCode(\"YHG45LT\");\n\n  bank.pay(bill);\n  Thread.sleep(5000);\n\n  double newBalance = bank.getBalance();\n  Thread.sleep(2000);\n\n  // new balance should be previous balance - 150\n  Assertions.assertEquals(newBalance, balance - 150);\n}\n\n\nFlaky test.\nTest code duplication.\nObscure test.\nLong method.\n\nExercise 5.\nIn the code below, we show an actual test from Apache Commons Lang, a very popular open source Java library. This test focuses on the static random() method, which is responsible for generating random characters. A very interesting detail in this test is the comment: Will fail randomly about 1 in 1000 times.\n/**\n * Test homogeneity of random strings generated --\n * i.e., test that characters show up with expected frequencies\n * in generated strings.  Will fail randomly about 1 in 1000 times.\n * Repeated failures indicate a problem.\n */\n@Test\npublic void testRandomStringUtilsHomog() {\n    final String set = \"abc\";\n    final char[] chars = set.toCharArray();\n    String gen = \"\";\n    final int[] counts = {0,0,0};\n    final int[] expected = {200,200,200};\n    for (int i = 0; i\nWhich one of the following is incorrect about the test?\n\nThe test is flaky because of the randomness that exists in generating characters.\nThe test checks for invalidly generated characters, and that characters are picked in the same proportion.\nThe method being static has nothing to do with its flakiness.\nTo avoid the flakiness, a developer could have mocked the random function. \n\nReferences\nTest code best practices:\n\nChapter 5 of Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java 8 with Junit.

Once we manually devised the test cases, we wrote them down as JUnit tests, which were executed by the machine. \nWhile we studied several techniques to design test cases in a systematic manner, they all required some human effort. Our computers, however, can help a great deal in designing test cases. This is exactly what we are going to discuss in the following chapters.\nWe are going to work smarter rather than harder, and take a look at different testing techniques that perform software testing in an intelligent way:\n\nWe first discuss static testing. In other words, how we can leverage program analysis to detect functional bugs and security vulnerabilities.\n\nWe discuss mutation testing. Mutation testing helps us in measuring the fault capability detection of our test suites. After all, a test suite capable of detecting most of the bugs is better than a test suite that is only able to detect a few bugs.\n\nWe discuss fuzz testing, where we will test the correctness of a program by automatically providing a (large number of) unexpected inputs. Fuzz testing is a common technique among security testers.\n\nFinally, in the search-based testing chapter, we will see how artificial intelligence or, more specifically, search algorithms, can help us in automatically devise test cases that fully cover the class under test.\n\n\n"},"chapters/intelligent-testing/static-testing.html":{"url":"chapters/intelligent-testing/static-testing.html","title":"Static testing","keywords":"","body":"Static testing\nStatic testing analyses the code characteristics without executing the application. It can be considered as an automated code review. It checks the style and structure of the code, and can be used to statically evaluate all possible code paths in the System Under Test (SUT).\nStatic analysis can quickly find low-hanging fruit bugs that can be found in the source code, e.g. using deprecated functions. Static analysis tools are scalable and generally require less time to set up. PMD, Checkstyle, Checkmarx are some common static analysis tools.\nThe classical approach underlying static analysis is checking the code for potential structural and/or stylistic rule violations. A code checker typically contains a parser and an acceptable rule set. We look at the following techniques for static analysis:\n\nPattern matching via Regular expressions\nSyntax analysis via Abstract Syntax Trees\n\nPattern matching\nPattern matching is a code checking approach that searches for pre-defined patterns in code. A Regular expression or RegEx is a sequence of characters that represent a pattern. Simply put, a regex engine reads code character-by-character and upon every character-match, progresses through the regular expression until no more characters remain. Depending on the logic, either a positive/negative reaction is returned indicating whether the final state was an accepting/rejecting state, or all code snippets that matched the pattern are returned.\nRegular expressions are usually represented using Finite State Automaton. Each node represents a state. We move from one state to the next by taking the transition that matches the input symbol. Below you see a few examples of regular expressions and their corresponding finite state automata. The node with an arrow is called the starting state. Green states are accepting states, and red states are rejecting states.\nThe regular expression that results in the following automata is 'bug'. An input of the string bug will transition from left to right, until we end up in the green state. However, an input of bag will move from first state to the second state, and then to the red state. Since there is no transition out of this state, we will stay here until the input finishes.\n\nRegex also have options to introduce wildcard characters. For example, the regular expression '.*bug' results in the following automata. . denotes any possible character, and * denotes 0 or many times. Hence, the following strings will be accepted by this pattern: bug and this is a bug. The following strings will be rejected by this pattern: bug!, bugs, bad bug.\n\nThe automata for '.*bug.*' is given below. It will accept any string that contains the characters b, u, g consecutively, at least once, before the occurrence of b, u, or g separately.\n\nRegular expressions have some limitations: First, they cannot count, so we need to explicitly program each scenario in the regex, which reduces flexibility. For example, if we wanted to allow at most 3 methods, we would need to create a regex with three explicit sub-patterns, one for each function occurrence. Second, regular expressions don't take semantics into account, so they create many false positives. For example, consider the following code snippet. Suppose that the regular expression, (\\s)*System.out.println\\(.*\\);, searches for all print statements in the code to remove them before deployment. It will find three occurrences in the code snippet, which are all FPs because the code is already disabled by a flag.\nboolean DEBUG = false;\n\nif (DEBUG){\n  System.out.println(\"Debug line 1\");\n  System.out.println(\"Debug line 2\");\n  System.out.println(\"Debug line 3\");\n}\n\nSyntax analysis\nA more advanced code checking approach is syntax analysis. It works by deconstructing input code into a stream of characters, that are eventually turned into a Parse Tree. Tokens are hierarchal data structures that are put together according to the code's logical structure.\n\nA Parse Tree is a concrete instantiation of the code, where each character is explicitly placed in the tree, whereas an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is an abstract version of the parse tree in which syntax-related characters, such as semi-colon and parentheses, are removed. An example of the AST of the code snippet above is given below.\n\nA static analysis tool using syntax analysis takes as input (a) an AST, and (b) a rule-set, and raises an alarm in case a rule is violated.\nFor example, for a rule allowing at most 3 methods, and the following code snippet, the AST will be parsed and an error will be raised for violating the rule. Contrarily, a very complicated regular expression would be needed to handle the varying characteristics of the four available methods, potentially resulting in false positives.\n\nAbstract Syntax Trees are used by compilers to find sematic errors — compile-time errors associated to the meaning of the program. ASTs are also be used for program verification, type-checking, and translating the program from one language to another.  \nPerformance of static analysis\n Typically, static analysis produces sound results, i.e. zero false negatives. This is because the tools have access to the whole codebase, and they can track all the possible execution paths a program might take. So, if there are any vulnerabilities, the tool should be able to find them. However, this comes at the cost of Completeness. Because it tracks all possible execution paths without seeing how the application behaves in action, some of the results might never be reached in an actual execution scenario, resulting in false positives.\n\nNote that static analysis can produce unsound results if a piece of code is added at runtime, because then the analysis will not be done on the new code-piece. This is one reason why the signatures that static analysis uses to detect bugs need to be kept up-to-date as the codebase evolves. However, this strategy will still not work for dynamically induced bugs.\n\n Soundness and Completeness are defined more extensively in the Security testing chapter. \n\nExercises\nExercise 1.

These tests will never fail!\nFault Detection Capability\nLet's discuss one more adequacy criterion: the fault detection capability.\nIt indicates the test's capability to reveal faults in the system under test.\nThe more faults a test can detect or, in other words, the more faults a test fails on, the higher its fault detection capability.\nUsing this criterion, we can indicate the quality of our test suite in a better way than with just the coverage metrics we have so far.\nThe fault detection capability does not just regard the amount of production code executed, but also the assertions made in the test cases.\nFor a test to be adequate according to this criterion, it has to have a meaningful test oracle (i.e., meaningful assertions).\nThe fault detection capability, as a test adequacy criterion, is the fundamental idea behind mutation testing.\nIn mutation testing, we change small parts of the code, and check if the tests can find the introduced fault.\nIn the previous example, we made a test suite that was not adequate at all, according to the fault detection capability.\nAs there were no assertions, the tests would never find any faults in the code.\nTests with assertions check if the result of the method is what we expect. We have a test oracle now.\n@Test\npublic void testGetValues() {\n  int[] values = Division.getValues(1, 1);\n  assertEquals(1, values[0]);\n  assertEquals(0, values[1]);\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testZero() {\n  int[] values = Division.getValues(1, 0);\n  assertNull(values);\n}\n\nTo see how the values in a test case influence the fault detection capability, let's create two tests, where the denominator is not 0.\n@Test\npublic void testGetValuesOnes() {\n  int[] values = Division.getValues(1, 1);\n  assertEquals(1, values[0]);\n  assertEquals(0, values[1]);\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testGetValuesDifferent() {\n  int[] values = Division.getValues(3, 2);\n  assertEquals(1, values[0]);\n  assertEquals(1, values[1]);\n}\n\nFor the fault detection capability, we want to see if the tests catch any faults that could be in the code.\nThis means we have to go back to the source code and introduce an error. \nWe replace the division by a multiplication; a clear bug:\npublic class Division {\n  public static int[] getValues(int a, int b) {\n    if (b == 0) {\n      return null;\n    }\n    int quotient = a * b; // the bug was introduced here\n    int remainder = a % b;\n\n    return new int[] {quotient, remainder};\n  }\n}\n\nIf we run our tests with the buggy code, we see that the test with the values 1 and 1 (the testGetValuesOnes() test) still passes, but the other test (the testGetValuesDifferent()) fails.\nThis indicates that the second test has a higher fault detection capability.\nEven though both tests exercise the method in the same way and execute the same lines, we see a difference in the fault detection capability.\nThis is because of the different input values for the method and the different test oracles (assertions) in the tests.\nIn this case, the input values and test oracle of the testGetValuesDifferent() test can better detect that bug.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypotheses for Mutation Testing\nThe idea of mutation testing is to assess the quality of the test suite.\nThis is done by manipulating bits of the source code and running the tests with this manipulated source code.\nIf we have a good test suite, at least one of the tests will fail on this changed (i.e., buggy) code.\nFollowing this procedure, we get a sense of the fault error capability of our test suite.\nIn mutation testing, we use mutants.\nThe mutants are the defects, or faults, that we introduce in the source code and then use to determine the quality of the test suite.\nA big question regarding the mutants is what their size should be.\nWe can change single operations, whole lines or even multiple lines of code.\nWhat would work best?\nMutation testing and the answer to this question are based on the following two hypotheses:\n\nThe Competent Programmer Hypothesis (CPH):\nHere, we assume that the program is written by a competent programmer.\nMore importantly, this means that given a certain specification, the programmer creates a program that is either correct, or it differs from a correct program by a combination of simple errors.\n\nThe Coupling Effect:\nThe coupling effect hypothesis states that simple faults are coupled to more complex faults.\nIn other words, test cases that detect simple faults, will also detect complex faults.\n\n\nBased on these two hypotheses, we can determine the size \nthat the mutants should have.\nRealistically, following the competent programmer hypothesis, \nthe faults in the actual code will be small.\nThis indicates that the mutants' size should be small as well.\nConsidering the coupling effect, test cases that detect \nsmall errors, will also be able to detect larger, more complex errors.\nTerminology\nTo talk about mutation testing in an in-depth way, let us define some terms:\n\nMutant: Given a program PPP, a mutant called P′P'P​′​​ is obtained by introducing a syntactic change to PPP. A mutant is killed if a test fails when executed with the mutant.\nSyntactic Change: A small change in the code. Such a small change should make the code still valid, i.e., the code can still compile and run.\nChange: A change, or alternation, to the code that mimic typical human mistakes. We will see some examples of these mistakes later.\n\nWe illustrate mutation testing with these concepts in the example below.\nSuppose we have a Fraction class with a method invert().\npublic class Fraction {\n  private int numerator;\n  private int denominator;\n\n  // ...\n\n  public Fraction invert() {\n1.  if (numerator == 0) {\n2.    throw new ArithmeticException(\"...\");\n    }\n3.  if (numerator == Integer.MIN_VALUE) {\n4.    throw new ArithmeticException(\"...\");\n    }\n5.  if (numerator \nWe have a test suite for this method as well:\n@Test\npublic void testInvert(){\n  Fraction f = new Fraction(1, 2);\n  Fraction result = f.invert();\n  assertEquals(2, result.getFloat(), 0.00001);\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testInvertNegative(){\n  Fraction f = new Fraction(-1, 2);\n  Fraction result = f.invert();\n  assertEquals(-2, result.getFloat(), 0.00001);\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testInvertZero(){\n  Fraction f = new Fraction(0, 2);\n  assertThrows(ArithmeticException.class, () -> f.invert());\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testInvertMinValue(){\n  int n = Integer.MIN_VALUE;\n  Fraction f = new Fraction(n, 2);\n  assertThrows(ArithmeticException.class, () -> f.invert());\n}\n\nWe have two tests for corner cases that throw an exception, and two more \"happy path\" tests.\nNow, let us determine the quality of our test suite, using mutation testing.\nFirst, we have to create a mutant by applying a syntactic change to the original method.\nKeep in mind that, because of the two hypotheses, we want the syntactic change to be small: one operation/variable should be enough.\nMoreover, the syntactic change is a change, hence it should mimic mistakes that could be made by a programmer.\nFor the first mutant we change line 6.\nInstead of -numerator we just say numerator.\nThe mutant looks like as follows:\npublic class Fraction {\n  private int numerator;\n  private int denominator;\n\n  // ...\n\n  public Fraction invert() {\n1.  if (numerator == 0) {\n2.    throw new ArithmeticException(\"...\");\n    }\n3.  if (numerator == Integer.MIN_VALUE) {\n4.    throw new ArithmeticException(\"...\");\n    }\n5.  if (numerator \nIf we would execute the test suite on this mutant, the testInvertNegative() test will fail, as result.getFloat() would be positive instead of negative.\nAnother mistake could be made in line 1.\nWhen we studied boundary analysis, we saw that it is important to test the boundaries due to off-by-one errors.\nWe can make a syntactic change by introducing such an off-by-on error.\nInstead of numerator == 0, in our new mutant we make it numerator == 1:\npublic class Fraction {\n  private int numerator;\n  private int denominator;\n\n  // ...\n\n  public Fraction invert() {\n1.  if (numerator == 1) {\n2.    throw new ArithmeticException(\"...\");\n    }\n3.  if (numerator == Integer.MIN_VALUE) {\n4.    throw new ArithmeticException(\"...\");\n    }\n5.  if (numerator \nWe see that, again, the test suite catches this error.\nThe test testInvertZero() will fail, as it expects an exception, but none is thrown in the mutant.\nAutomation\nManually writing the mutations of our programs might take a lot of time. \nMoreover, we probably would only think of the cases that are already tested.\nLike with test execution, we want to automate the mutation process.\nThere are various tools that automatically generate mutants for mutant testing, but they all use the same methodology.\nFirst we need mutation operators.\nA mutation operator is a grammatic rule that can be used to introduce a syntactic change.\nThis means that, if the generator sees a statement in the code that corresponds to the grammatic rule of the operator (e.g., a + b), then the mutation operator specifies how to change this statement with a syntactic change (e.g., turning it into a - b).\nWe distinguish two categories of mutation operators:\n\nReal fault based operators: Operators that are very similar to defects seen in the past for the same kind of code. Such operators look like common mistakes made by programmers in similar code.\nLanguage-specific operators: Mutations that are made specifically for a certain programming language. For example, changes related to the inheritance feature we have in Java, or changes regarding pointer manipulations in C, which we cannot simply apply to all the languages.\n\nMost mutation testing tools include various basic mutation operators for real fault based operators.\nWe briefly go over some common mutation operators:\n\nAOR - Arithmetic Operator Replacement: Replaces an arithmetic operator by another arithmetic operator. Arithmetic operators are +, -, *, /, %.\nROR - Relational Operator Replacement: Replaces a relational operator by another relational operator. Relational operators are , >=, !=, ==, >, .\nCOR - Conditional Operator Replacement: Replaces a conditional operator by another conditional operator. Conditional operators are &&, ||, &, |, !, ^.\nAOR - Assignment Operator Replacement: Replaces an assignment operator by another assignment operator. Assignment operators include =, +=, -=, /=.\nSVR - Scalar Variable Replacement: Replaces each variable reference by another variable reference that has been declared in the code.\n\nFor each of the mutation operators, we provide an example.\nWe first show the original code, and then the mutant that could be given by the mutant operator.\nArithmetic Operator Replacement\nOriginal:\nint c = a + b;\n\nExample of a mutant:\nint c = a - b;\n\nRelational Operator Replacement\nOriginal:\nif (c == 0) {\n  return -1;\n}\n\nExample of a mutant:\nif (c > 0) {\n  return -1;\n}\n\nConditional Operator Replacement\nOriginal:\nif (a == null || a.length == 0) {\n  return new int[0];\n}\n\nExample of a mutant:\nif (a == null && a.length == 0) {\n  return new int[0];\n}\n\nAssignment Operator Replacement\nOriginal:\nc = a + b;\n\nExample of a mutant:\nc -= a + b;\n\nScalar Variable Replacement\nOriginal:\npublic class Division {\n  public static int[] getValues(int a, int b) {\n    if (b == 0 || b == Integer.MIN_VALUE){\n      return null;\n    }\n\n    int quotient = a / b;\n    int remainder = a % b;\n\n    return new int[] {quotient, remainder};\n  }\n}\n\nExample of a mutant:\npublic class Division {\n  public static int[] getValues(int a, int b) {\n    if (a == 0 || a == Integer.MIN_VALUE){\n      return null;\n    }\n\n    int quotient = b / a;\n    int remainder = quotient % a;\n\n    return new int[] {remainder, a};\n  }\n}\n\nSpecifically to Java, there are a lot of language-specific operators.\nWe can, for example, change the inheritance of the class, remove an overriding method, or change some declaration types.\nWe will not go into detail about these language-specific mutant operators, but some examples are:\n\nAccess Modifier Change\nHiding Variable Deletion\nHiding Variable Insertion\nOverriding Method Deletion\nParent Constructor Deletion\nDeclaration Type Change\n\nOf course, there exist many more mutant operators that are used by mutant generators.\nFor now, you should at least have an idea what mutation operators are, how they work and what we can use them for.\n\n\n\n\n\nMutation Analysis and Testing\nOur goal is to use mutation testing to determine the quality of our test suite.\nWe have seen that we first have to create the mutants and that it is best to do this in an automated way with the help of mutant operators.\nThen, we run the test suite against the created mutants with an execution engine.\nIf one of the tests fails, we say that the test suite kills the mutant.\nThis is good, as it suggests that our test suite has some fault detection capability.\nIf none of the tests in our test suite fails when executed against the mutant, this mutant stays alive.\nThis process is illustrated in the diagram below:\n\nWhen performing mutation testing, we count the number of mutants our test suite killed and the number of mutants that were still alive.\nBy counting the number of each of these mutant groups, we can give a value to the quality of our test suite.\nWe define the Mutation Score as:\nMutation score =killed mutantsmutants\\text{Mutation score } = \\frac{\\text{killed mutants}}{\\text{mutants}}Mutation score =​mutants​​killed mutants​​\nComputing this mutation score is what we call mutation analysis. More formally, mutation analysis means assessing the quality of a test suite, by computing its mutation score.\nWhen the mutation score is low, we might want to change or add new test cases in our test suite.\nThis is called mutation testing.\nAgain, the definition:\nmutation testing means improving the quality of the test suite using mutants (by adding and/or changing test cases).\nThese concepts are very related to each other.\nTo do mutation testing, you have to compute the mutation score first.\nThis then indicates whether the test suite should be changed.\nIf the mutation score is low, there are a lot of mutants that are not killed by the test suite.\nThen, it is indeed our job to improve the test suite.\nEquivalent Mutants\nCalculating the mutation score is, in practice, challenging.\nThe mutation score increases when less mutants are alive.\nThis suggests that the best scenario is to have all the mutants killed by the test suite.\nWhile this is indeed the best scenario, it is often unrealistic.\nSome of the mutants are impossible to kill and will then always stay alive.\nMutants that cannot be killed are called equivalent mutants.\nAn equivalent mutant is a mutant that always behaves as the original program.\nIf the mutant behaves like the normal code, it will always give the same output as the original program for any given input.\nClearly, this makes this mutant (which is basically the same program as the one under test) impossible to be killed by the tests.\nHere, the equivalence is related to the definition of program equivalence.\nProgram equivalence roughly means that two programs are functionally equivalent when they produce the same output for every possible input.\nThis is also the equivalence between the normal code and an equivalent mutant.\nLet's have a look at the following method. We left some irrelevant parts out.\npublic void foo(int a) {\n  int index = 10;\n  while (...) {\n    // ...\n    index--;\n    if (index == 0)\n      break;\n  }\n}\n\nOur mutation testing tool generates a mutant using relational operator replacement.\nThe mutant is as follows:\npublic void foo(int a) {\n  int index = 10;\n  while (...) {\n    // ...\n    index--;\n    if (index \nNote how the original code starts with index set to 10, decrements it at every iteration of the while loop, and breaks out of the loop when index equals 0.\nThe mutant works exactly the same, even though the condition is technically different.\nThe index is still decremented from 10 to 0.\nBecause index will never be negative, the == operator does the same as the  operator.\nThe mutant produced by the generator is an equivalent mutant in this case.\nBecause of these equivalent mutants, we need to change the mutation score formula.\nWe do not want to take the equivalent mutants into account, as there is nothing wrong with the tests when they do not kill these mutants.\nThe new formula becomes:\nMutation score=killed mutantsnon-equivalent mutants\\text{Mutation score} = \\frac{\\text{killed mutants}}{\\text{non-equivalent mutants}}Mutation score=​non-equivalent mutants​​killed mutants​​\nFor the denominator, we just count the number of non-equivalent mutants, instead of all the mutants.\nTo compute this new mutation score automatically, we would need a way to automatically determine whether a mutant is an equivalent mutant.\nUnfortunately, we cannot do this automatically,\nas detecting equivalent mutations is an undecidable problem. We can never be sure that a mutant behaves the same as the original program for every possible input.\nApplication\nMutation testing sounds like a great way to analyse and improve our test suites.\nThe question is, however, if we can actually use mutation testing in practice.\nFor example, we can ask ourselves whether a test suite with a higher mutation score actually finds more errors.\nA lot of research done in software engineering tries to bring some insights to this problem.\nAll the existing studies about mutation testing showed that mutants can indeed give a good indication for a test suite's fault detection capability, as long as the mutant operators are carefully selected and the equivalent mutants are removed.\nMore specifically, a study by Just et al. shows that mutant detection is positively correlated with real fault detection.\nIn other words, the more mutants a test suite detects, the more real faults the test suite can detect as well.\nEven more interesting is that this correlation is independent from the coverage.\nFurthermore, the correlation between mutant detection and fault detection is higher than the correlation between statement coverage and fault detection.\nSo, the mutation score provides a better measure for the fault detection capability than the test coverage.\nThe costs of mutation testing\nMutation testing is not without its costs.\nWe have to generate the mutants, possibly remove the equivalent mutants, and execute the tests with each mutant.\nIn fact, mutation testing is quite expensive, i.e., it takes a long time to perform.\nLet's assume we want to do some mutation testing.\nWe have:\n\nA code base with 300 Java classes\n10 test cases for each class\nEach test case takes 0.2 seconds on average\nThe total test execution time is then: 300⋅10⋅0.2=600300 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 0.2 = 600300⋅10⋅0.2=600 seconds (10 minutes)\n\nThis execution time is for just the normal code.\nFor the mutation testing, we decide to generate on average 20 mutants per class.\nWe will have to execute the entire test suite of a class on each of the mutants.\nPer class, we need 20⋅10⋅0.2=4020 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 0.2 = 4020⋅10⋅0.2=40 seconds.\nIn total, the mutation testing will take 300⋅40=12000300 \\cdot 40 = 12000300⋅40=12000 seconds, or 3 hours and 20 minutes.\nBecause of this cost, researchers have tried to find ways to make mutation testing faster for a long time.\nBased on some observations, they came up with a couple of heuristics.\n\nThe first observation is that a test case can never kill a mutant if it does not cover the statement that changed (also known as the reachability condition).\nBased on this observation, we only have to run the test cases that cover the changed statement.\nThis reduces the number of test cases to run and, with that, the execution time.\nFurthermore, once a test case kills a mutant, we do not have to run the other test cases anymore.\nThis is because the test suite needs at least one test case that kills the mutant.\nThe exact number of test cases killing the same mutant does not really matter.\n\nA second observation is that mutants generated by the same operator and injected at the same location are likely to be coupled to the same type of fault.\nThis means that when we use a certain mutation operator (e.g., Arithmetic Operator Replacement) and we replace the same statement with this mutant operator, we get two mutants that represent the same fault in the code.\nIt is then highly likely that if the test suite kills one of the mutants, it will also kill the others.\nAn heuristic that follows from this observation is to run the test suite against a subset of all the mutants (a technique also known as do fewer).\nObviously, when we run the test suite against a smaller number of mutations, the overall testing will take less time.\nThe simplest way of selecting the subset of mutants is by means of random sampling.\nAs the name suggests, we just pick random mutants to consider.\nThis is a very simple, yet effective way to reduce the execution time.\n\n\nThere exist other heuristics to decrease the execution time, like e-selective or cluster mutants and operators, but we will not go into detail of those heuristics.\nTools\nTo perform mutation testing you can use one of many publicly available tools.\nThese tools are often made for specific programming languages.\nOne of the most mature mutation testing tools for Java is called PIT.\nPIT can be run from the command line, but it is also integrated in most popular IDEs (like

these mutants.\nThen it generates easy to read reports based on the results.\nIn these reports, you can see the line coverage and mutation score per class.\nFinally, you can also see more detailed

Fuzzers bombards the System Under Test (SUT) with randomly generated inputs in the hope to cause crashes. A crash can either originate from failing assertions, memory leaks, or improper error handling. Fuzzing has been successful in discovering unknown bugs in software.\nNote that fuzzing cannot identify flaws that do not trigger a crash.\n\nRandom fuzzing is the most primitive type of fuzzing, where the SUT is considered as a complete black-box, with no assumptions about the type and format of the input. It can be used for exploratory purposes, but it takes a long time to generate any meaningful test cases. In practice, most software takes some form of structured input that is pre-specified, so we can exploit that knowledge to build more efficient fuzzers.\nThere are two ways of generating fuzzing test cases:\n\nMutation-based Fuzzing creates permutations from example inputs to be given as testing inputs to the SUT. These mutations can be anything ranging from replacing characters to appending characters. Since mutation-based fuzzing does not consider the specifications of the input format, the resulting mutants may not always be valid inputs. However, it still generates better test cases than the purely random case. ZZuf is a popular mutation-based application fuzzer that uses random bit-flipping. American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) is a fast and efficient security fuzzer that uses genetic algorithms to increase code coverage and find better test cases.\n\nGeneration-based Fuzzing, also known as Protocol fuzzing, regards the file format and protocol specification of the SUT when generating test cases. Generative fuzzers take a data model as input that specify the input format, and the fuzzer generates test cases that only alter the values while conforming to the specified format. For example, for an application that takes JPEG files as input, a generative fuzzer would fuzz the image pixel values while keeping the JPEG file format intact. PeachFuzzer is an example of generative fuzzer.\n\n\nCompared to mutative fuzzers, generative fuzzers are less generalizable and difficult to set-up because they require input format specifications. However, they perform a more through testing by increasing code coverage and producing high-quality test cases.\nMaximizing code coverage\nA difficult thing about effective software testing is to generate test cases that not only maximizes the code coverage, but do so in a way that tests for a wide range of possible values. Fuzzing helps achieve this goal by generating wildly diverse test cases. For example, this blog post by Regehr describes the use of fuzzing in order to optimally test an ADT implementation.\nWe want the fuzzer to generate these test cases in a reasonable time.\nThere are various ways in which we achieve maximal code coverage in less time:\n\nMultiple tools\nTelemetry as Heuristics\nSymbolic execution\n\nMultiple tools\nA simple yet effective way to maximize code coverage is to use multiple fuzzing tools. Each fuzzer performs mutations in a different way, so they can be run together to cover different parts of the search-space in parallel. For example, using a combination of a mutative and generative fuzzer can help both, generate diverse test cases, while also ensuring valid inputs.\nTelemetry as Heuristics\nIf the code structure is known (i.e. in a white-box setting), telemetry about code coverage can help constraint the applied mutations. For example, for the if() statement in the following code snippet, a heuristic based on branch-coverage requires 3 test cases to fully cover it, while that based on statement-coverage requires only 1 test case. Hence, using branch-coverage ensures that all three branches are tested at least once. Such heuristics can be used to select only those mutations that continually increase code coverage.\nfunc(int a, int b){\n    int a  = a + b;\n    int b = a - b;\n  if (a > 2)\n      return ‘Yes!’;\n  else if (b \nSymbolic execution\nWe can specify the potential values of variables that allow the program to reach a desired path, using so-called Symbolic variables. We assign symbolic values to these variables rather than explicitly enumerating each possible value.\nWe can then construct formula of a Path predicate that answers this question: Given the path constraints, is there any input that satisfies the path predicate?. We then only fuzz the values that satisfy these constraints. A popular tool for symbolic execution is Z3. It is a combinatorial solver that, when given path constraints, can find all combinations of values that satisfy the constraints. The output of Z3 can be given as an input to a generative or mutative fuzzer to optimally test various code paths of the SUT.\nThe path predicate for the else if() branch in the previous code snippet will be: ((N+M=2)&(N100))((N+M ((N+M=2)&(N100)). The procedure to derive it is as follows:\n\na and  b are converted into symbolic variables, such that their values are: a=Na=Na=N and b=Mb=Mb=M.\n\nThen, a=N+Ma = N+Ma=N+M and b=(N+M)−M=>Nb = (N+M) - M => Nb=(N+M)−M=>N\n\nThe path constraint for the if() branch is: (N+M>2)(N+M > 2)(N+M>2), so the constraint for other branches will be its inverse: (N+M=2)(N+M (N+M=2).\n\nThe path constraint for else if() branch is: (N100)(N (N100).\n\nHence, the final path predicate for the else if() branch is the combination of the two: (N+M=2)&(N100)(N+M (N+M=2)&(N100)\n\n\nNote that it is not always possible to determine the potential values of a variable because of the halting problem — answering whether a loop terminates with certainty is an undecidable problem. So, for a code snippet given below, Symbolic execution may give an imprecise answer.\nfunc(int a, bool b){\n a = 2;\n while(b == true) {\n   // some logic\n }\n a = 100;\n}\n\nFor interested readers, we recommend the \"fuzzing book\": https://www.fuzzingbook.org!\n\nReferences\n\nFuzzing for bug hunting. https://www.welcometothejungle.com/en/articles/btc-fuzzing-bugs\n\n"},"chapters/intelligent-testing/sbst.html":{"url":"chapters/intelligent-testing/sbst.html","title":"Search-based software testing","keywords":"","body":"Search-based software testing\n"},"chapters/testing-into-context/":{"url":"chapters/testing-into-context/","title":"Testing in the context","keywords":"","body":"Testing into context\n"},"chapters/testing-into-context/web-testing.html":{"url":"chapters/testing-into-context/web-testing.html","title":"Web testing (soon)","keywords":"","body":"Web Testing\n"},"chapters/non-functional-testing/":{"url":"chapters/non-functional-testing/","title":"Non-functional testing","keywords":"","body":"Non-functional testing\n"},"chapters/non-functional-testing/security-testing.html":{"url":"chapters/non-functional-testing/security-testing.html","title":"Security testing","keywords":"","body":"Security Testing\nIn May of 2018, a Code Injection Vulnerability was discovered in the Desktop Signal app. An attacker could execute code on a victim's machine by sending a specially crafted message. The victim's app would hand over the /etc/passwd file, and even send all the chats in plain text, without any human intervention! This was ironic since Signal is known for its end-to-end encryption feature.\nWhy did this vulnerability exist, and how we could have avoided it? In this chapter, we answer these questions and introduce the concept of security testing.\nAfter reading this chapter, you should be able to:\n\nExplain the key difference between traditional software testing and security testing,\nUnderstand the cause of security vulnerabilities in Java applications,\nImplement the Secure Software Development Life Cycle,\nExplain the various facets of Security Testing,\nEvaluate the key differences between SAST and DAST.\n\nSoftware vs. security testing\nWe start this chapter with what you already know: software testing. The key difference between software testing and security testing is as follows:\n\nThe goal of software testing is to check the correctness of the implemented functionality, while the goal of security testing is to find bugs (i.e. vulnerabilities) that can potentially allow an intruder to make the software behave insecurely.\n\nSecurity testing is all about finding those edge cases in which a software can be made to malfunction. What makes a security vulnerability different from a typical software bug is the assumption that an intruder may exploit it to cause harm. Often, a software bug is exploited to be used as a security vulnerability, e.g. entering a specially crafted input that triggers a buffer overflow may be used to extract sensitive information from a system's memory. This was done in the Heartbleed vulnerability that made 2/3rd2/3^{rd}2/3​rd​​ of all web servers in the world leak passwords. However, security vulnerabilities are not necessarily software bugs, and are also not always functional, e.g. authentication cookies never being invalidated allows a Cross Site Request Forgery attack, in which an attacker exploits a valid cookie to forge a victim's action.  \n Similar to traditional testing, thoroughly testing software does not guarantee the absence of security vulnerabilities. In fact, new variants of exploits can pop up at any time and can hit even a time-tested software. This is why security testing is not a one-off event, but has to be incorporated in the whole Software Development Lifecycle.\nWe discuss the Secure Software Development Life Cycle later in this chapter.\n\nSecurity testers are always at an arms-race with the attackers. Their aim is to find and fix the vulnerabilities before the adversary gets the chance to exploit them.\nYou can think of the attack surface as the surface of a rubber balloon, as shown in the figure: there are endless points on this surface that, when pricked by a needle (exploit analogy) will pop the balloon. The goal of security testing is to limit the exposed attack surface and to increase the efforts required by the attackers to exploit it.\n\nUnderstanding Java vulnerabilities\nIn this chapter, we investigate the threat landscape of Java applications because of its popularity: 3 billion devices run Java globally according to Oracle. Also, Java is often considered to be a more mature language: Java handles memory management and garbage collection itself, unlike C that requires developers to handle these tasks manually. However, the added abstraction layers might make Java code slower than native C code; this is why some Java components are built upon native code for optimization purposes.\n\nThe Java Virtual Machine, the sandbox that enables Java programs to execute platform-independently, is itself written in C.\n\nIn order to understand the threat landscape for Java applications, we must analyze what kind of security vulnerabilities have been discovered in them over the years. There exist online repositories that consolidate such vulnerability information. The NIST National Vulnerability Database is one such example.\nThe National Vulnerability Database is the largest repository of security vulnerabilities that are discovered in open source software. Each vulnerability is assigned a unique CVE (Common Vulnerability and Exposures) identifier, a CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) that determines the type of vulnerability, and a CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score that determines the severity of the vulnerability. Additionally, you can also view the products and their versions that are affected by the vulnerability.\nJRE vulnerabilities\n\nThe plots show the number of vulnerabilities (left) and type of vulnerabilities (right) in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) from 2007 to 2019. The spike in 2013 and 2014 is due to the exploitation of the Type Confusion Vulnerability (explained later), that allows a user to bypass the Java Security Manager and perform high privileged actions.\nAndroid vulnerabilities\n\nThe second set of plots show vulnerabilities discovered between 2009 and 2019 in Android OS, which is mostly written in Java.\nWhat is interesting to see in these plots is that the top 3 vulnerability types are related to bypassing controls, executing code in unauthorized places, and causing denial of service. Hence, we see that although memory corruption is not a major threat for Java applications, the effects caused by classical buffer overflows in C applications can still be achieved in Java by other means.\nVulnerability use cases\nLet's take the following commonly exploited vulnerabilities in Java applications, and analyze how they work:\n\nCode injection vulnerability\nUpdate attack\n\n\nType confusion vulnerability\nBypassing Java Security Manager\n\n\nBuffer overflow vulnerability\nArbitrary Code Execution (ACE)\nRemote Code execution (RCE)\n\nCode injection vulnerability\nThe code snippet below has a Code Injection vulnerability.  \n\nSocket socket = null;\nBufferedReader readerBuffered = null;\nInputStreamReader readerInputStream = null;\n\n/*Read data using an outbound tcp connection */\nsocket = new Socket(\"host.example.org\", 39544);\n\n/* Read input from socket */\nreaderInputStream = new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream(), \"UTF-8\");\nreaderBuffered = new BufferedReader(readerInputStream);\n\n/* Read data usign an outbound tcp connection */\nString data = readerBuffered.readLine();\n\nClass tempClass = Class.forName(data);\nObject tempClassObject = tempClass.newInstance();\n\nIO.writeLine(tempClassObject.toString());\n\n// Use tempClass in some way\n\nThe Class.forName(data) is the root cause of the vulnerability. If you look closely, the object's value is loaded dynamically from host.example.org:39544. If the host is controlled by an attacker, they can freely introduce malicious code in the application logic at run-time. A famous version of this attack is an Update attack in Android applications, where a plugin seems benign, but it downloads malicious code at run-time.\nStatic analysis tools often fail to detect this attack, since the malicious code is not part of the application logic at the checking time.\n\nDue to the variations that Code Injection can present itself in, it is the top entry in the OWASP Top 10 list of vulnerabilities. To limit its effect, developers can disallow 'untrusted' plugins, and can limit the privileges that a certain plugin has, e.g. by disallowing plugins to access sensitive folders.\n\nType confusion vulnerability\nThis vulnerability was present in the implementation of the tryfinally() method in the Reflection API of the Hibernate ORM library. Due to insufficient type checks in this method, an attacker could cast objects into arbitrary types with varying privileges.\nThe Type confusion vulnerability is explained in this blog by Vincent Lee, from where we take the example below.\nclass Cast1 extends Throwable {\n  Object lemon;\n}\n\nclass Cast2 extends Throwable {\n  Lime lime;\n}\n\npublic static void throwEx() throws Throwable {\n  throw new Cast1();\n}\n\npublic static void handleEx(Cast2 e) {\n  e.lime.makeLimenade();\n}\n\nSuppose that an attacker wants to execute the makeLimenade() method of the Lime object, but only has access to a lemon of type Object. The attacker exploits the fact that throwEx() throws a Cast1 (lemon) object, while handleEx() accepts a Cast2 (lime) object.\nFor the sake of brevity, consider that the output of throwEx() is an input to handleEx(). In the old and vulnerable version of Java, these type mismatches did not raise any alerts, so an attacker could send a lemon object that was then cast into a Lime type object, hence allowing them to call the makeLimenade() function from (what was originally) a lemon.\nIn a real setting, an attacker can use this type confusion vulnerability to escalate their privileges by bypassing the Java Security Manager (JSM). The attacker's goal is to access System.security object and set it to null, which will disable the JSM. However, the security field is private and cannot be accessed by an object that the attacker has (let's call it Obj). So, they will exploit the type confusion vulnerability to cast Obj into something that does have higher privileges and access to the System.security field. Once the JSM is bypassed, the attacker can execute whatever code they want to.\nArbitrary Code Execution (ACE)\nA common misconception is that Java, unlike C, is not vulnerable to Buffer overflows. In fact, any component implemented in native code is as much vulnerable to exploits as the original C code would be. An interesting example here is of graphics libraries that often use native code for fast rendering.\nAn earlier version of a GIF library in the Sun JVM contained a memory corruption vulnerability: A valid GIF component with the block's width set to 0 caused a buffer overflow when the parser copied data to the under-allocated memory chunk. This overflow caused multiple pointers to be corrupted, and resulted in Arbitrary Code Execution (see CVE-2007-0243 for more details).\nA similar effect was caused by an XML deserialization bug in the XStream library: while deserializing XML into a Java Object, a malicious XML input caused the memory pointer to start executing code from arbitrary memory locations (which could potentially be controlled by an attacker).\nWhen an ACE is triggered remotely, it is called a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. The underlying principle is the same: it is also caused by Improper handling of 'special code elements'. We have seen it in the Spring Data Commons library, a part of the Spring framework that provides cloud resources for database connections.\nAn Oracle report in 2018 stated that most of the Java vulnerabilities can be remotely exploited. With 3 billion devices running Java, this creates a large attack surface.\nThe Secure Software Development Life Cycle (Secure-SDLC)\nSecurity testing is a type of non-functional testing, but if it fails to fix security vulnerabilities, (i) there is a high impact on the functionality of the application, e.g. a denial of service attack that makes the entire application unreachable, and (ii) it also causes reputation and/or monetary loss, e.g. loss of customers.\nThere is an interesting debate about who gets the responsibility for security testing.\nThe pragmatic approach is to include security testing in each phase of the SDLC.\nThe figure below shows the Secure-SDLC variant of the traditional SDLC taken from this article by Rohit Singh.\n\nAt the planning phase, risk assessment should be done and potential abuse cases should be designed that the application will be protected against. In the analysis phase, the threat landscape should be explored, and attacker modelling should be done.\n\nFor example, an attacker model is that the vendor that supplies the plugins has been infected, so all plugins received from the vendor might be malicious.\n\nThe design and implementation plans of the application should include insights from the attacker model and abuse cases.\n\nFor example, the choice of certain libraries, and the permissions assigned to certain modules should be guided by the threat landscape under consideration.\n\nSecurity testing should be a part of the testing and integration phases. Code reviews should also be done from the perspective of the attacker (using abuse cases). Finally, during the maintenance phase, in addition to bug fixes, developers should keep an eye on the CVE database and update (if possible) the vulnerable components in the application.\nJust like the traditional SDLC is not a one-time process, the Secure-SDLC is also a continuous process. Therefore, security testing should also be integrated into the Continuous Integration framework as well.\nCurrently, most companies solely do penetration testing which tests the entire application at the very end of the SDLC. The problem with penetration testing is that it tests the application as a whole, and does not stress-test each individual component. When security is not an integral part of the design phase, the vulnerabilities discovered in the penetration testing phase are patched in an ad-hoc manner that increase the risk of them falling apart after deployment.\nFacets of security testing\nAs such, the term security testing is very broad and it covers a number of overlapping concepts. We classify them as follows:\n\n\n\n\nWhite-box\nBlack-box\n\n\n\n\nStatic Application Security Testing\nCode checking, Pattern matching, ASTs, CFGs,  DFDs\n\n\n\nDynamic Application Security Testing\nTainting, Dynamic validation, Symbolic  execution\nPenetration testing,  Reverse engineering, Behavioral analysis,  Fuzzing\n\n\n\nYou should already be familiar with white/black-box testing, static testing and some of the mentioned techniques.\n In this chapter, we specifically focus on how to use these techniques to find security vulnerabilities. \n\nIn the context of automated security testing, static and dynamic analysis are called Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), respectively.\nBefore we dive into further explanation of SAST and DAST techniques, let's look at the assessment criteria evaluating the quality of security testing techniques.\nQuality assessment criteria\nThe quality of testing tools is evaluated in a number of ways. You have already learnt about code coverage in a previous chapter. Here, we discuss four new metrics that are often used in the context of security testing:\nDesigning an ideal testing tool requires striking a balance between two measures: (a) Soundness, and (b) Completeness.\nSoundness dictates that there should be no False Negatives (FN) — no vulnerability should be skipped. This implies that no alarm is raised IFF there is no existing vulnerability in the System Under Test (SUT). Completeness dictates that there should be no False Positives (FP) — no false alarm should be raised. This implies that an alarm is raised IFF a valid vulnerability is found.\nA perfect testing tool is both sound and complete. However, this is an undecidable problem — given finite time, the tool will always be wrong for some input. In reality, tools often compromise of FPs or FNs.\nLow FNs are ideal for security critical applications where a missed vulnerability can cause significant loss, e.g. banking apps. Low FPs are ideal for applications that don't have a lot of manpower to evaluate the correctness of each result.\nAdditionally, an ideal testing tool is interpretable: an analyst can trace the results to a solid cause, and are scalable: the tool can be used for large applications without compromising heavily on performance.\nStatic Application Security Testing (SAST)\nSAST techniques aim to find security bugs without running the application. They can find bugs that can be observed in the source code and for which signatures can be made, e.g. SQL Injection and basic Cross-Site Scripting. SpotBugs, FindSecBugs, and Coverity are static analysis tools specially meant to test security problems in applications.\nSAST is not only limited to code checking — it includes any approach that does not require running the SUT. For example, Risk-based testing  is a business-level process where we model the worst-case scenarios (or abuse cases) using threat modelling. An application is tested against the generated abuse cases to check its resilience against them. Risk-based testing can be done both statically and dynamically.\nBelow, we discuss SAST techniques and provide examples of the security bugs that they can find.\n\nCode checking for security\nPattern matching via RegEx\nSyntax analysis via Abstract Syntax Trees\n\n\nStructural testing for security\nControl Flow Graphs (CFGs)\nData Flow Diagrams (DFDs)\n\n\n\nCode checking for security\nPattern matching via RegEx\nPattern matching can find simplistic security issues, such as:\n\nMisconfigurations, like port 22 being open for every user,\nPotentially bad imports, like importing the whole System.IO namespace,\nCalls to dangerous functions, like strcpy and memcpy.\n\nSyntax analysis via AST\nAbstract Syntax Trees can also find security misconfigurations in the codebase, and sometimes are more appropriate than using regular expressions. Code that violates security specifications can be detected by walking the AST. For example, for a rule specifying how the print function should be used, i.e. printf(format_string, args_to_print), and the following code snippet, an error will be raised because of a missing parameter that can be detected by counting the child-nodes.\n\nThis is an example of the famous Format string attack, which exploits a vulnerability in the printf() function family: in the absence of a format string parameter like %s, an attacker can supply their own format string parameter in the input, which will be evaluated as a pointer resulting in either arbitrary code execution or the denial of service.\nStructural testing for security\nControl Flow Graphs (CFGs)\nRecall that Control Flow Graphs show how the control is transferred among different pieces of code in an application. A CFG is an over-estimation of what any potential execution might look like — it is the union of all possible combinations of execution paths.\nFor security testers, a CFG is an overall picture of an application's behavior, in a graphical format. It can help testers pin-point strange control transfers, e.g.\n\nan unintended transition going from a low- to a high- privileged code block, or\ncertain unreachable pieces of code that can result in application hanging and eventually, a denial of service.\n\nExisting literature has used CFGs to detect the maliciousness of an application based on how its CFG looks like. For example, this work by Bruschi et al. detects self-mutating malware by comparing its CFG with CFGs of known malwares, and this work by Sun et al. uses CFGs to measure code reuse as a means to detect malware variants.\nData Flow Diagram (DFD)\nA DFD is built on top of a CFG and shows how data traverses through a program. Since Data Flow Analysis (DFA) is also a static approach, a DFD tracks all possible values a variable might have during any execution of the program. This can be used to detect sanitization problems, such as the deserialization vulnerability that caused an ACE, and some simplistic code injection vulnerabilities.\nHow DFA works: A user-controlled variable whose value we intend to track is called a Source, and the other variables are called Sinks. We say that the Source variables are tainted and all Sinks are untainted. For a Source to be connected to a Sink, it must first be untainted by proper input validation, for example.\nIn DFA, we prove that (a) No tainted data is used, and (b) No untainted data is expected. An alert is raised if either of the two conditions are violated. Consider the following scenario for a single Source and Sink. There exists a direct path between a Source and a Sink, which violates the first rule. This indicates that a malicious user input can cause an SQL injection attack. The solution to fix this violation is to include an input clean-up step between the Source and Sink variables.\n\nThe code snippet below shows a real case that DFA can detect. The variable data is tainted, as it is received from a user. Without any input cleaning, it is directly used in println() method that expects untainted data, thus raising an alert.\n/* Uses bad source and bad sink */\npublic void bad(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)\n  throws Throwable {\n\n  String data;\n\n  /* Potential flaw: Read data from a queryString using getParameter */\n  data  = request.getParameter(\"name\");\n\n  if (data != null) {\n    /* Potential flaw: Display of data in web pages after using\n    * replaceAll() to remove script tags,\n    * will still allow XSS with string like ipt>. */\n    response.getWriter().println(\"bad(): data = \" + \n        data.replaceAll(\"()\", \"\"));\n  }\n}\n\n A dynamic version of Data Flow Analysis is called Taint analysis, where the tainted variables' values are tracked in memory. We cover it in the DAST section of this chapter. \n\nReaching Definitions Analysis\n One application of DFA is called the Reaching Definitions. It is a top-down approach that identifies all the possible values of a variable. For security purposes, it can detect the Type Confusion vulnerability and Use-after-free vulnerability (which uses a variable after its memory has been freed).\n Consider the following code snippet and its CFG given below:\nint b = 0;\nint c = 1;\n\nfor (int a = 0; a  1)\n    b = 10;\n  else\n    c = b;\n}\nreturn b, c;\n\n\nThe solid transitions show control transfers, while the dotted transitions show data transfers. Suppose that we want to perform reaching definitions analysis of the three variables: a, b, and c. First, we label each basic block, and draw a table that lists the variable values in each block.\n\nIf a variable is not used in the block, or the value remains the same, nothing is listed. At the end, each column of the table is merged to list the full set of potential values for each variable.\n\n\n\ncode blocks\na\nb\nc\n\n\n\n\nb1\n-\n0\n1\n\n\nb2\n0, a++\n-\n-\n\n\nb3\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nb4\n-\n10\n-\n\n\nb5\n-\n-\nb\n\n\nb6\n-\n-\n-\n\n\n\nRemember, if the value of a variable is controlled by a user-controlled parameter, it cannot be resolved until run-time, so it is written as it is.\nIf a variable X copies its value to another variable Y, then the reaching definitions analysis dictates that the variable Y will receive all potential values of X, once they become known.\nAlso, whether a loop terminates is an undecidable problem (also called the halting problem), so finding the actual values that a looping variable takes on is not possible using static analysis.\nThe analysis results in the following values of the three variables. If you look closely, some values are impossible during actual run-time, but since we trace the data flow statically, we perform an over-estimation of the allowed values. This is why, static analysis, in particular DFA, is Sound but Imprecise.\na = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}\nb = {0, 10}                // 0 is impossible       \nc = {1, b} -> {0, 1, 10}  // 1, 10 are impossible\n\nDynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)\nApplication crashes and hangs leading to Denial of Service attacks are common security problems. They cannot be detected by static analysis since they are only triggered when the application is executed.\nDAST techniques execute an application and observe its behavior. Since DAST tools typically do not have access to the source code, they can only test for functional code paths, and the analysis is only as good as the behavior triggering mechanism. This is why, search-based algorithms have been proposed to maximize the code coverage, e.g. see this work by Gross et al. and this work by Chen et al..\nDAST tools are typically difficult to set-up, because they need to be hooked-up with the SUT, sometimes even requiring to modify the SUT's codebase, e.g. for instrumentation. They are also slower because of the added abstraction layer that monitors the application's behavior. Nevertheless, they typically produce less false positives and more advanced results compared to SAST tools. Even when attackers obfuscate the codebase to the extent that it is not statically analyzable anymore, dynamic testing can still monitor the behavior and report strange activities. BurpSuite, SunarQube, and OWASP's ZAP are some dynamic security testing tools.\nIn this section, we explain the following techniques for dynamic analysis:\n\nTaint analysis\nDynamic validation\nPenetration testing\nBehavioral analysis\nReverse Engineering\nFuzzing\n\nTaint analysis\nTaint analysis is the dynamic version of Data Flow Analysis. In taint analysis, we track the values of variables that we want to taint, by maintaining a so-called taint table. For each tainted variable, we analyze how the value propagates throughout the codebase and affects other statements and variables. To enable tainting, code instrumentation is done by adding hooks to variables that are of interest. Pin is an instrumentation tool from Intel, which allows taint analysis of binaries.\nAn example here is of the tool Panorama that detects malicious software like keyloggers (that log keystrokes in order to steal credentials) and spyware (that stealthily collects and sends user data to 3rd3^{rd}3​rd​​ parties) using dynamic taint analysis. Panorama works on the intuition that benign software does not interfere with OS-specific information transfer, while information-stealing malware attempts to access the sensitive information being transferred. Similarly, malicious plugins collect and share user information with 3rd3^{rd}3​rd​​ parties while benign plugins don't send information out. These behaviors can be detected using the source/sink principles of taint analysis.  \nDynamic validation\nDynamic validation does a functional testing of the SUT based on the system specifications. It basically checks for any deviations from the pre-defined specifications. Model Checking is a similar idea in which specifications are cross-checked with a model that is learnt from the SUT. Model checking is a broad field in the Software Verification domain.\nThis work by Chen et al. codifies security vulnerabilities as safety properties that can be analyzed using model checking. For example, they analyze processes that may contain race conditions that an attacker may exploit to gain control over a system. In this regard, consider the following code snippet. Suppose that the process first checks the owner of foo.txt, and then reads foo.txt. An attacker may be able to introduce a race condition in between the two statements and alter the symbolic link of foo.txt such that it starts referring to /etc/passwd file. Hence, what the user reads as foo.txt is actually the /etc/passwd file that the attacker now has access to.\nFiles.getOwner(\"foo.txt\");\nFiles.readAllLines(\"foo.txt\");\n\nTo check the existence of such scenarios, they codify it in a property that stops a program from passing the same filename to two system calls on the same path. Once codified in a model checker, they run it on various softwares and report on deviations from this property.   \nPenetration testing\nPenetration (or Pen) testing is the most commonly used type of security testing in organizations. It is sometimes also referred as Ethical hacking. What makes pen testing different from others is that it is done from the perspective of an attacker — pen-testers attempt to breach the security of the SUT just as an adversary might. Since it is done from the perspective of the attacker, it is generally black-box, but depending on the assumed knowledge of the attacker, it may also be white-box.\nPenetration testing checks the SUT in an end-to-end fashion, which means that it is done once the application is fully implemented, so it can only be done at the end of the SDLC. MetaSploit is an example of a powerful penetration testing framework. Most pen testing tools contain a Vulnerability Scanner module that either runs existing exploits, or allow the tester to create an exploit. They also contain Password Crackers that either brute-force passwords (i.e. tries all possible combinations given some valid character set), or perform a dictionary attack (i.e. chooses inputs from pre-existing password lists).\nBehavioral analysis\nGiven a software that may contain modules from unknown sources, behavioral analysis aims to gain insights about the software by generating behavioral logs and analyzing them. This can be particularly helpful for finding abnormal behaviors (security problems, in particular) when neither the source code, nor the binary are accessible. The logs can be compared with known-normal behavior in order to debug the SUT.\nAn example here is of JPacman that currently has support for two point calculator modules (Scorer 1 and Scorer 2) that calculate the score in different ways. The goal is to find what the malicious module (Scorer 2) does. We have implemented a Naïve Fuzzer that automatically runs various instances of JPacman to generate behavioral logs. At each iteration, it randomly picks a move (from the list of acceptable moves) until Pacman dies, and logs the values of different interesting variables. The fuzzing code is given below.\n  /**\n   * Basic fuzzer implementation.\n   *\n   * @param repetitionInfo repeated test information\n   * @throws IOException when the log write created.\n   */\n  @RepeatedTest(RUNS)\n  void fuzzerTest(RepetitionInfo repetitionInfo) throws IOException {\n      Game game = launcher.getGame();\n      Direction chosen = Direction.EAST;\n\n      String logFileName = \"log_\" + repetitionInfo.getCurrentRepetition() + \".txt\";\n      File logFile = new File(logDirectory, logFileName);\n\n      try (BufferedWriter logWriter = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(\n          new FileOutputStream(logFile, true), StandardCharsets.UTF_8))) {\n\n          logWriter.write(LOG_HEADER);\n\n          try {\n              game.start();\n\n              while (game.isInProgress()) {\n                  chosen = getRandomDirection();\n\n                  log(logWriter, chosen);\n                  game.getLevel().move(game.getPlayers().get(0), chosen);\n              }\n          } catch (RuntimeException e) {\n              // Runtime exceptions should not stop the execution of the fuzzer\n          } finally {\n              log(logWriter, chosen);\n              game.stop();\n          }\n      }\n  }\n\nBelow you see an example of a log file resulting from one run of the fuzzer.\n\nIn the figure below, the plots on the right show how the value of score variable changes overtime. It is apparent that something goes wrong with Scorer 2, since the score is typically programmed to increase monotonically.\n\nBehavioral logs are a good data source for forensic analysis of the SUT.\nReverse Engineering (RE)\nReverse Engineering is a related concept where the goal is to reveal the internal structure of an application. We can consider RE as a system-wide process that converts a black-box application into a white-box. RE is, strictly speaking, not a testing technique, but it is useful when (i) converting legacy software into a modern one, or (ii) understanding competitor's product.\nA use case for the behavioral logs from previous technique is to use them for automated reverse engineering that learns a model of the SUT. This model can then be used for, e.g. Dynamic validation, and/or to guide path exploration for better code coverage.\nFor example, TABOR learns a model of a water treatment plant in order to detect attacks. They learn an automata representing the normal behavior of the various sensors present in the plant. Anomalous incoming events that deviate from the normal models raise an alert.\nFuzzing\nFuzzing has been used to uncover previously-unknown security bugs in several applications. American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) is an efficient security fuzzer that has been used to find security vulnerabilities in command-line-oriented tools, like PuTTY, openSSH, and sqlite. This video shows how to fuzz ImageMagik using AFL to find security bugs.\nAdditionally, in 2015 a severe security vulnerability, by the name of Stagefright, was discovered in Android smartphones that impacted 1 billion devices. It was present in the library for unpacking MMS messages, called libstagefright. A specially crafted MMS message could silently cause an overflow leading to remote code execution and privilege escalation. It was discovered by fuzzing the libstagefright library using AFL that ran ~3200 tests per second for about 3 weeks!\nFinally, Sage is a white-box fuzzing tool that combines symbolic execution with fuzzing to find deeper security bugs. They report a use case of a critical security bug that black-box fuzzing was unable to find, while Sage discovered it in under 10 hours, despite having no prior knowledge of the file format.\nPerformance evaluation of SAST and DAST\n\nStatic analysis tools create a lot of FPs because they cannot see the run-time behavior of the code. They also generate FNs if they don't have access to some code, e.g. code that is added at run-time.\nDynamic analysis reduces both FPs and FNs — if an action is suspicious, an alarm will be raised. However, even in this case, we cannot ensure perfect testing.  \nStatic analysis is generally more white-box than dynamic analysis, although there are interpretable dynamic testing methods, like symbolic execution.\nStatic testing is more scalable in the sense that it is faster, while black-box dynamic testing is more generalizable.\n\nChapter Summary\n\nSoftware testing checks correctness of the software, while security testing finds potential defects that may be exploited by an intruder.\nEven though Java handles memory management itself, Java applications still have a large attack surface.\nSecurity testing is much more than penetration testing, and must be integrated at each step of the SDLC.\nThreat modelling can derive effective test cases.\nPerfect (security) testing is impossible.\nSAST checks the code for problems without running it, while DAST runs the code and monitors its behavior to find problems.\nSAST is fast, but generates many false positives. DAST is operationally expensive, but generates insightful and high-quality results.\nPattern matching finds limited but easy to find security problems.\nASTs make the code structure analysis easy. CFGs and DFDs are better at finding security vulnerabilities.\nBehavioral logs are very useful for forensic analysis of the SUT.\nCombining fuzzing with Symbolic execution leads to finding optimal test cases that can maximize code coverage and find maximum security problems.\n\nExercises\nExercise 1. Why is security testing hard?\n\nTo find a vulnerability, you must fully understand assembly code.\nPointers are hard to follow since they can point to any memory location.\nHacking is difficult and requires many years of specialization.\nThere exist a lot of strange inputs, and only few trigger a vulnerability.\n\nExercise 2. Give an example of a software bug that also qualifies as a security vulnerability, and also explain how.\nExercise 3. Static analysis can detect some classes of injection vulnerabilities more reliably than others. Which vulnerability is static analysis most likely to prevent?\n\nCross-Site Scripting\nCross-Site Request Forgery\nUpdate attack\nFormat string injection\n\nExercise 4.

All others help people in understanding that variation, different types of testing, is important.\nIntroduction to software testing automation\nWriting tests is fun, isn't it?\nSpecification-based testing\nExercise 1\nA group of inputs that all make a method behave in the same way.\nExercise 2\nWe use the concept of equivalence partitioning to determine which tests can be removed.\nAccording to equivalence partitioning we only need to test one test case in a certain partition.\nWe can group the tests cases in their partitions:\n\nDivisible by 3 and 5: T1, T2\nDivisible by just 3 (not by 5): T4\nDivisible by just 5 (not by 3): T5\nNot divisible by 3 or 5: T3\n\nOnly the partition where the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 has two tests.\nTherefore we can only remove T1 or T2.\nExercise 3\nFollowing the category partition method:\n\nTwo parameters: key and value\nThe execution of the program does not depend on the value; it always inserts it into the map.\nWe can define different characteristics of the key:\nThe key can already be present in the map or not.\nThe key can be null.\n\n\nThe requirements did not give a lot of parameters and/or characteristics, so we do not have to add constraints.\nThe combinations are each of the possibilities for the key with any value, as the programs execution does not depend on the value.\nWe end up with three partitions:\nNew key\nExisting key\nnull key\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nThere are no right or wrong answers to this exercise. \nIt services to show that a lot of decisions that we make are based on what we know about the system (or, in this case, what we assume about the system).\nBut, when context kicks in, there might be more possible invalid test cases then just the cases in the boundaries.\nWhatever decisions you as a tester make regarding specific invalid test cases, it is important to justify those decisions.\nFor example:\n\nDo we feel the need of testing negative numbers separately from positive numbers? From the specification, there's no reason to do so. \nIf you look at the source code (supposing you have access to the source code, does it make you feel like this test is needed?\nDo we feel the need of testing trailing zeroes? Maybe the user inputs a string which is converted later... Then, testing might be important.\nDo we feel the need to test extreme numbers, like Integer.MAX_VALUE or even passing a long int or float there? \nDo we feel the need to test with a string consisting of only 1 letter, or maybe more than 2 letters? \nIf there's no input validation, unintended behaviour might be right around the corner \nDo we feel the need to test lowercase letters? Maybe the program can't distinguish between lower- and uppercase letters.\n\nExamples of possible invalid partitions:\n\n[Integer.MIN_VALUE, 999]\n[4001, Integer.MAX_VALUE] \n[AA, B]\n[N, Z]\n[0000, 0999] \n[AAA, ZZZ]\n\nExercise 5\n\nP1: Element not present in the set\nP2: Element already present in the set\nP3: NULL element.\n\nThe specification clearly makes the three different cases of the correct answer explicit.\nExercise 6\nOption 4 is the incorrect one.\nThis is a functional testing technique. No need for source code.\nExercise 7\nPossible actions:\n\nWe should treat file names 'no-filename with this name' and 'omitted' as exceptional, and thus, test them just once.\nWe should treat pattern size 'empty' as exceptional, and thus, test it just once.\nWe should constrain the options in the 'occurrences in a single line' category to happen only if 'occurrences in the file' are either exactly one or more than one. It does not make sense to have none occurrences in a file and one pattern in a line.\nWe should treat 'pattern is improperly quoted' as exceptional, and thus, test it just once.\n\nExercise 8\nThis focus of this exercise is for you to see that the internal state of the object should also be taken into account in the partitions (and not only the direct input variables).\nInput parameter e: \n\nP1: Element not present in the set\nP2: Element already present in the set\nP3: NULL element.\n\nSet is full?  (isFull comes from the state of the class)\n\nisFull == true\nisFull == false\n\nWith the categories and partitions in hands, we can constrain the isFull == true and test it only once (i.e., without combining with other classes). \nWe then combine them all and end up with four tests:\n\nT1: isFull returns false, e: Element not present in the set\nT2: isFull returns false, e: Element present in the set\nT3: isFull returns false, e: Null element\nT4: isFull returns true, e: Element not present in the set\n\nBoundary testing\nExercise 1\nThe on-point is the value in the conditions: half.\nWhen i equals half the condition is false.\nThen the off-point makes the condition true and is as close to half as possible.\nThis makes the off-point half - 1.\nThe in-points are all the points that are smaller than half.\nPractically they will be from 0, as that is what i starts with.\nThe out-points are the values that make the condition false: all values equal to or larger than half.\nExercise 2\nThe on-point is 10.\nHere we are dealing with an equality; the value can both go up and down to make the condition false.\nAs such, we have two off-points: 9 and 11.\nExercise 3\nThe on-point can be read from the condition: 570.\nThe off-point should make the condition false (the on-point makes it true): 571.\nAn example of an in-point is 483.\nThen the condition evaluates to true.\nAn example of an out-point, where the condition evaluates to false, is 893.\nExercise 4\nAn on-point is the (single) number on the boundary. It may or may not make the condition true. The off point is the closest number to the boundary that makes the condition to be evaluated to the opposite of the on point. Given it's an inequality, there's only a single off-point.\nExercise 5\non point = 1024, off point = 1025, in point = 1028, out point = 512\nThe on point is the number precisely in the boundary = 1024. off point is the closest number to the boundary and has the opposite result of on point. In this case, 1024 makes the condition false, so the off point should make it true. 1025. In point makes conditions true, e.g., 1028. Out point makes the condition false, e.g., 512.\nExercise 6\nThe decision consists of two conditions, so we can analyse these separately.\nFirst note that the modulo function % is not a linear function, therefore there is no single on and off point.\n\n(Graph of f(n) = n % 3, desmos.com)\nFor n % 3 == 0 any multiple of 3 would work as an on-point.\nBecause we can't exhaustively test all multiples of 3, only one of them should be tested. Lets use 3 for this exercise.\nThere are also infinitely many off points we can pick. Choosing the respective off-points of our on-point should suffice. Off-points: 2 and 4.\nSimilarly to the first condition for n % 5 == 0 we have an on-point of 5.\nNow the off-points are 4 and 6.\nExercise 7\nWe should always test the behaviour of our program when any expected data actually does not exist (EXISTENCE).\nExercise 8\nWe have a lot of boundaries to test for:\n\n\n\n\n\nTo establish the needed tests in the category/partition method, we need to identify the parameters, derive the characteristics, add constraints and final make the tests.\nAs we last step we can identify duplicate tests and remove those.\n\nIdentify parameters:\nLegs\nTail\nLives\nSharp nails\nSound\n\n\nDerive characteristics of parameters:\nint legs: [0,2,4,6,8,10,integer.MAX_VALUE], [1,3,5,7,9,integer.MAX_VALUE], [negative value]\nbool tail: [true], [false]\nint lives: [1-9], no lives, more than 10 lives\nbool sharp nails: [true], [false]\nstring sound: ['miauw'], ['woof'], [empty]\n\n\nAdd constraints:\nIf lives , we can test this with just one combination.\nIf legs is an negative integer or 0, this is an exceptional case. Therefore it doesn't matter if the animal has sharp nails or not.\nIf legs is not an even integer, we can test this with just one combination.\nIf lives >= 10, we can test this with just one combination. \n\n\nTest cases: Tests can be divided in 3 categories: is a cat, not a cat, exceptional cases.\nCat\n2, true, 6, true, \"miauws\" --> cat\n\n\nNot a cat\n3, true, 6, true, \"miauws\" --> not a cat\n4, false, 6, true, \"miauws\" --> not a cat\n6, true, 11, true, \"miauws\" --> not a cat\n8, true, 4, false, \"miauws\" --> not a cat\n2, true, 3, true, \"woof\" --> not a cat\n\n\nExceptional\n0, true, 2, false, \"miauws\" --> cat or invalid depending on the context of the program.\n2, true, 11, true, \"miauws\" --> not a cat\n3, true, 8, true, \"miauws\" --> not a cat\n4, true, 0, true, \"miauws\" --> not a cat or invalid depending on the context of the program.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that some tests can be combined! For example: \n\nTEST-1 from not a cat is the same as TEST-3 from exceptional\nTEST-3 from not a cat is the same as TEST-2 from exceptional\n\nSo the total number of tests = 8.\nStructural testing\nExercise 1\nExample of a test suite that achieves 100%100\\%100% line coverage:\n@Test\npublic void removeNullInListTest() {\n    LinkedList list = new LinkedList<>();\n\n    list.add(null);\n\n    assertTrue(list.remove(null));\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void removeElementInListTest() {\n    LinkedList list = new LinkedList<>();\n\n    list.add(7);\n\n    assertTrue(list.remove(7));\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void removeElementNotPresentInListTest() {\n    LinkedList list = new LinkedList<>();\n\n    assertFalse(list.remove(5))\n}\n\nNote that there exists a lot of test suites that achieve 100%100\\%100% line coverage, this is just an example.\nYou should have 3 tests.\nAt least one test is needed to cover lines 4 and 5 (removeNullInListTest in this case).\nThis test will also cover lines 1-3.\nThen a test for lines 9 and 10 is needed (removeElementInListTest).\nThis test also covers lines 6-8.\nFinally a third test is needed to cover line 11 (removeElementNotPresentInListTest).\nExercise 2\n\nLn in the diagram represents the line number of the code that is in the block or decision.\nExercise 3\nOption 1 is the false one.\nA minimal test suite that achieves 100\\% (either basic or full) condition has the same number of tests as a minimal test suite that achieves 100\\% branch coverage. All decisions have just a single branch, so condition coverage doesn't make a difference here. Moreover, a test case that exercises lines 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 achieves around 54\\% coverage (6/11).\nExercise 4\nExample of a test suite that achieves 100%100\\%100% branch coverage:\n@Test\npublic void removeNullAsSecondElementInListTest() {\n  LinkedList list = new LinkedList<>();\n\n  list.add(5);\n  list.add(null);\n\n  assertTrue(list.remove(null));\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void removeNullNotPresentInListTest() {\n  LinkedList list = new LinkedList<>();\n\n  assertFalse(list.remove(null));\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void removeElementSecondInListTest() {\n  LinkedList list = new LinkedList<>();\n\n  list.add(5);\n  list.add(7);\n\n  assertTrue(list.remove(7));\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void removeElementNotPresentInListTest() {\n  LinkedList list = new LinkedList<>();\n\n  assertFalse(list.remove(3));\n}\n\nThis is just one example of a possible test suite.\nOther tests can work just as well.\nYou should have a test suite of 4 tests.\nWith the CFG you can see that there are decisions in lines 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8.\nTo achieve 100%100\\%100% branch coverage each of these decisions must evaluate to true and to false at least once in the test suite.\nFor the decision in line 1, we need to remove null and something else than null. This is done with the removeElement and removeNull tests.\nThen for the decision in line 2 the node that remove is looking at should not be null and null at least once in the tests.\nThe node is null when the end of the list had been reached.\nThat only happens when the element that should be removed is not in the list.\nNote that the decision in line 2 only gets executed when the element to remove is null.\nIn the tests, this means that the element should be found and not found at least once.\nThe decision in line 3 checks if the node that the method is at now has the element that should be deleted.\nThe tests should cover a case where the element is not the item that has to be removed and a case where the element is the item that should be removed.\nThe decisions in lines 7 and 8 are the same as in lines 2 and 3 respectively.\nThe only difference is that lines 7 and 8 will only be executed when the item to remove is not null.\nExercise 5\nFirst, we find the pairs of tests that can be used for each of the conditions:\n\nA: {2, 6}\nB: {1, 3}, {2, 4}, {5, 7}\nC: {5, 6}\n\nFor A and C we need the decisions 2, 5 and 6.\nThen you can choose to add either 4 or 7 to cover condition B.\nThe possible answers are: {2, 4, 5, 6} or {2, 5, 6, 7}.\nExercise 6\n\nL\\ represents the line numbers that the code blocks cover.\nExercise 7\nA lot of input strings give 100% line coverage.\nA very simple one is \"aa\".\nAs long as the string is longer than one character and makes the condition in line 9 true, it will give 100% line coverage.\nFor \"aa\" the expected output is \"a\".\nExercise 8\nOption 4 is the incorrect one.\nThe loop in the method makes it impossible to achieve 100% path coverage.\nThis would require us to test all possible number of iterations.\nFor the other answers we can come up with a test case: \"aXYa\"\nExercise 9\nFirst the condition coverage.\nWhen talking about condition coverage, we first have to split the condition on line 1 (n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 == 0) \ninto two decision blocks for the CFG. In total, we will have 8 conditions:\n\nLine 1: n % 3 == 0, true and false\nLine 1: n % 5 == 0, true and false\nLine 3: n % 3 == 0, true and false\nLine 5: n % 5 == 0, true and false\n\nT1 makes conditions 1 and 2 true and then does not cover the other conditions.\nFor T2 we need to pay special attention. The input number 8 is neither divisible by 3, nor divisible by 5. \nHaving the CFG in mind, notice that when the first part of the condition on line 1 (namely n % 3 == 0) is evaluated to false,\nthe second part will not even be evaluated since the && is a lazy operator. Therefore, we will end up following the false paths \nof the first, third and the forth decision block.\nIn total, these test cases then cover 2+3=52 + 3 = 52+3=5 conditions so the condition coverage is 58⋅100%=62.5%\\frac{5}{8} \\cdot 100\\% = 62.5\\%​8​​5​​⋅100%=62.5%\nNow the decision coverage.\nWe have 6 decisions:\n\nLine 1: n % 3 == 0 && n % 5 == 0, true and false\nLine 3: n % 3 == 0, true and false\nLine 5: n % 5 == 0, true and false\n\nNow T1 makes decision 1 true and does not cover the other decisions.\nT2 makes all the decision false.\nTherefore, the coverage is 46⋅100%=66%\\frac{4}{6} \\cdot 100\\% = 66\\%​6​​4​​⋅100%=66%.\nExercise 10\n\nThe L\\ in the blocks represent the line number corresponding to the blocks.\nExercise 11\nAnswer: 3.\nOne test to cover lines 1 and 2.\nAnother test to cover lines 1, 3-7 and 8-13.\nFinally another test to cover lines 14 and 15. This test will also automatically cover lines 1, 3-10.\nExercise 12\nAnswer: 4.\nFrom the CFG we can see that there are 6 branches.\nWe need at least one test to cover the true branch from the decision in line 1.\nThen with another test we can cover false from L1 and false from L8.\nWe add another test to cover false from the decision in line 10.\nFinally an additional test is needed to cover the true branch out of the decision in line 10.\nThis gives us a minimum of 4 tests.\nExercise 13\nMC/DC does subsume statement coverage. Basic condition coverage does not subsume branch coverage; full condition coverage does.\nExercise 14\nOption 1 is correct.\nExercise 15\nConsider the following table:\n\n    DecisionABC(A & B) | C\n    1TTTT\n    2TTFT\n    3TFTT\n    4TFFF\n    5FTTT\n    6FTFF\n    7FFTT\n    8FFFF\n\n\nTest pairs for A = {(2,6)}, B = {(2,4)} and C = {(3, 4), (5, 6), (7,8)}.\nThus, from the options, tests 2, 3, 4 and 6 are the only ones that achieve 100% MC/DC.\nNote that 2, 4, 5, 6 could also be a solution.\nExercise 16\nThe table for the given expression is:\n\n\n\nTests\nA\nB\nResult\n\n\n\n\n1\nF\nF\nF\n\n\n2\nF\nT\nT\n\n\n3\nT\nF\nT\n\n\n4\nT\nT\nF\n\n\n\nFrom this table we can deduce sets of independence pairs for each of the parameters:\n\nA: {(1, 3), (2, 4)}\nB: { (empty) }\n\nWe can see that there is no independence pair for B. \nThus, it is not possible to achieve MC/DC coverage for this expression.\nSince there is no independence pair for B, this parameter has no effect on the result.\nWe should recommend the developer to restructure the expression without using B, which will make the code easier to maintain.\nThis example shows that software testers can contribute to the code quality not only by spotting bugs, but also by suggesting changes that result in better maintainability.\nModel-Based Testing\nExercise 1\n\nYou should not need more than 4 states.\nExercise 2\n\nExercise 3\n\n  \n    \n    temperature reached\n    too hot\n    too cold\n    turn on\n    turn off\n  \n  \n    Idle\n    \n    Cooling\n    Heating\n    \n    Off\n  \n  \n    Cooling\n    Idle\n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    Heating\n    Idle\n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    Off\n    \n    \n    \n    Idle\n    \n  \n\n\nThere are 14 empty cells in the table, so there are 14 sneaky paths that we can test.\nExercise 4\n(Exercise removed)\nExercise 5\nWe have a total of 6 transitions.\nOf these transitions the four given in the test are covered and order cancelled and order resumed are not.\nThis coves a transition coverage of 46⋅100%=66.7%\\frac{4}{6} \\cdot 100\\% = 66.7\\%​6​​4​​⋅100%=66.7%\nExercise 6\n\n  \n    STATES\n    Events\n  \n  \n    \n    Order received\n    Order cancelled\n    Order resumed\n    Order fulfilled\n    Order delivered\n  \n  \n    Submitted\n    Processing\n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    Processing\n    \n    Cancelled\n    \n    Shipped\n    \n  \n  \n    Cancelled\n    \n    \n    Processing\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    Shipped\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Completed\n  \n  \n    Completed\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\nExercise 7\nAnswer: 20.\nThere are 20 empty cells in the decision table.\nAlso we have 5 states.\nThis means 5⋅5=255 \\cdot 5 = 255⋅5=25 possible transitions.\nThe state machine gives 5 explicit transitions so we have 25−5=2025 - 5 = 2025−5=20 sneak paths.\nExercise 8\nFirst we find pairs of decisions that are suitable for MC/DC: (We indicate a decision as a sequence of T and F. TTT would mean all conditions true and TFF means C1 true and C2, C3 false)\n\nC1: {TTT, FTT}, {FTF, TTF}, {FFF, TFF}, {FFT, TFT}\nC2: {TTT, TFT}, {TFF, TTF}\nC3: {TTT, TTF}, {FFF, FFT}, {FTF, FTT}, {TFF, TFT},\n\nAll condition can use the TTT decision, so we will use that.\nThen we can add FTT, TFT and TTF.\nNow we test each condition individually with it changing the outcome.\nIt might look line we are done, but MC/DC requires each action to be covered at least once.\nTo achieve this we add the FFF and TFF decision as test cases.\nIn this case we need to test each explicit decision in the decision table.\nExercise 9\n\nExercise 10\n\nExercise 11\n\nExercise 12\n\nExercise 13\nThere will be one extra super state (ACTIVE), which will be a super-state of the existing WARMING and DEFROSTING states.

The primary use of integration tests is to find mistakes in the communication between a system and its external dependencies\nUnit tests do not cover as much as integration tests. They cannot cover the communication between different components of the system.\nWhen using system tests the bugs will not be easy to identify and find, because it can be anywhere in the system if the test fails. Additionally, system tests want to execute the whole system as if it is run normally, so we cannot just mock the code in a system test.\nThe different test levels do not find the same kind of bugs, so settling down on one of the levels is not a good idea.\n\nExercise 3\nCorrect answer: Changing the transaction auto-commit to true is not really required. It would be better to actually exercise the transaction policy your application uses in production (4)\nExercise 4\nCorrect answer: Transitioning from a testing pyramid to an ice-cream cone anti-pattern (4)\nExercise 5\nUnit testing.\nExercise 6\nCorrect answer: The interaction with the system is much closer to reality (1)\nExercise 7\nCorrect answer: System tests tend to be slow and often are non-deterministic (4)\nSee https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html!\nMock Objects\nExercise 1\nThe correct answer is 4.\n\nThis line is required to create a mock for the OrderDao class.\nWith this line we check that the methods calls start with order on a delivery mock we defined. The method is supposed to start each order that is paid but not delivered.\nWith this line we define the behaviour of the paidButNotDelivered method by telling the mock that it should return an earlier defined list.\nWe would never see this happen in a test that is testing the OrderDeliveryBatch class. By mocking the class we do not use any of its implementation. But the implementation is the exact thing we want to test. In general we never mock the class under test.\n\nExercise 2\nYou need mocks to both control and observe the behaviour of the (external) conditions you mocked.\nExercise 3\nOption 1 is the false one. We can definitely get to 100% branch coverage there with the help of mocks.\nExercise 4\nOnly approach 2.\nExercise 5\nGiven that the condition we have in InvoiceFilter is x , we have:\n\nOn-point: 100. 100 should be out of the returned list of invoices.\nOff-point: 101. 101 should be in the returned list of invoices.\n(Random) In-point: 500.\n(Random off-point): 50.\n\nA single test with these four invoices is a good test for the boundaries of the problem.\nDesign for Testability\nExercise 1\nTo test just the runBatch method of OrderDeliveryBatch (for example in a unit test) we need to be able to use mocks for at least the dao and delivery objects.\nIn the current implementation this is not possible, as we cannot change dao or delivery from outside the class.\nIn other words: We want to improve the controllability to improve the testability.\nThe technique that we use to do so is called dependency injection.\nWe can give the dao and delivery in a parameter of the method:\npublic class OrderDeliveryBatch {\n\n  public void runBatch(OrderDao dao, DeliveryStartProcess delivery) {\n    List orders = dao.paidButNotDelivered();\n\n    for (Order order : orders) {\n      delivery.start(order);\n\n      if (order.isInternational()) {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"5 days from now\");\n      } else {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"2 days from now\");\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nAlternatively we can create fields for the dao and delivery and a constructor that sets the fields:\npublic class OrderDeliveryBatch {\n\n  private OrderDao dao;\n  private DeliveryStartProcess delivery;\n\n  public OrderDeliveryBatch(OrderDao dao, DeliveryStartProcess delivery) {\n    this.dao = dao;\n    this.delivery = delivery;\n  }\n\n  public void runBatch() {\n    List orders = dao.paidButNotDelivered();\n\n    for (Order order : orders) {\n      delivery.start(order);\n\n      if (order.isInternational()) {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"5 days from now\");\n      } else {\n        order.setDeliveryDate(\"2 days from now\");\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nExercise 2\nThe method and class lack controllability.\nWe cannot change the values that Calender gives in the method because the getInstance method is static.\nMockito cannot really mock static methods, which is why we tend to avoid using static methods.\nWe can use dependency injection to make sure we can control the today object by using a mock.\nExercise 3\nThe correct answer is 1 and 3.\nAs we discussed it is very important to keep the domain and infrastructure separated for the testability.\nThis can be done, for example, by using Ports and Adapters.\nStatic methods cannot be mocked and are therefore very bad for the controllability of the code.\nCode that has low controllability also has a low testability, so replacing the static methods by non-static ones will be very beneficial to the testability.\nThe large tables and lack of indices do not really influence the testability, especially not when talking about unit tests.\nWhen writing unit tests we end up mocking the classes interacting with the database anyway.\nToo many attributes/fields can hurt testability as we might need to create a lot of mocks for just one class under test.\nHowever, the static methods and mixed domain and infrastructure are worse for the testability than a large number of attributes/fields.\nExercise 4\n\nObservability: The developer needs to be able to better observe the result.\nControllability: The developer has to be able to change (control) a certain variable or field.\nControllability: The developer should be able to control what instance of a class the class under test uses.\n\nTest-Driven Development\nExercise 1\n\nWrite failing test\nFailing test\nMake test pass\nPassing test\nRefactor\n\nFrom the explanation above:\n\nExercise 2\nHow did it feel to practice TDD?\nExercise 3\nOption 1 is the least important one.\nAlthough a few studies show that the number of tests written by TDD practitioners are often higher than the number of tests written by developers not practicing TDD, this is definitely not the main reason why developers have been using TDD. In fact, among the alternatives, it's the least important one. All other alternatives are more important reasons, according to the TDD literature (e.g., Kent Beck's book, Freeman's and Pryce's book.\nExercise 4\nOption 1 is not a benefit of TDD. The\nTDD literature says nothing about team integration.\nTest code quality\nExercise 1\nBoth tests are very slow.\nExercise 2\nMystery guest\nExercise 3\nIt is hard to tell which of several assertions within the same test method will cause a test failure.\nExercise 4\nFlaky test.\nExercise 5\nTo avoid the flakiness, a developer could have mocked the random function. It does not make sense, the test is about testing the generator and its homogeneity; if we mock, the test looses its purposes.\nMutation testing\nExercise 1\nMutation testing.\nStatic testing\nExercise 1.\nRegular expressions cannot count instances.\nExercise 2.\nStatic analysis produces over-generalized results with some false positives, so the analysis is Sound but Imprecise.\nSecurity testing\nExercise 1.\nThere exist a lot of strange inputs, and only few trigger a vulnerability.\nExercise 2.\nAn infinite loop can be triggered by attackers to do a Denial of Service attack. (Must explain how an attacker may misuse it. )\nExercise 3.\n4: Format string injection can be done with syntax analysis. Update attack cannot be detected by static analysis. XSS and XSRF are also tricky because input sanitization methods can be bypassed at run-time.\nExercise 4.\nAll of the above.

Tracking which data the program under test (spyware) accesses, and where that data flows is one way to detect spyware. For example, we know that /etc/passwd is sensitive, so we taint it. If a program requests it, we can follow the taint and see if it is being sent over the network.\nExercise 7.\nx = {0,12,21}\ny = {1,2,3,...}\n\n Since reaching  definitions  analysis  produces all the  possible  values  a  variable  might take, resulting in over-generalization and false positives.\n"},"chapters/testing-techniques/domain-testing.html":{"url":"chapters/testing-techniques/domain-testing.html","title":"Domain testing examples","keywords":"","body":"Domain testing examples\nThis chapter follows a problem-based approach.
